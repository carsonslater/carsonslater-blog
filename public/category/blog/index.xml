      <title>Returning to Europe</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear reader,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that if you take the time to read this post, you may be encouraged to draw near to Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and to whom are all things. My prayer is that you grow in the assurance of your calling to reconciliation with God and His mission on this earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-prior-experiences&#34;&gt;My Prior Experiences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I had the amazing opportunity to join a team from my church in Arizona on a trip to the Czech Republic where we partnered with a local Czech church to facilitate an English Camp. At this camp, we shared the gospel with youth in their area through various talks and small group discussions in the evenings. I embarked on the trip with an awareness of Europe’s larger attitude toward Protestant Christianity, having previously served in Romania three times, but I came back to the States with a yearning to return, in order that I may continue to walk in the good works the Lord has prepared for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am excited to write to you now to inform you that God has provided an opportunity for me to return to the Czech Republic, only for a longer period of time. After going to Europe to engage people with the gospel four times, I cannot deny the strategy I see behind living in Europe as a Christian, let alone serving alongside missionaries who are already actively working there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-why&#34;&gt;My &amp;lsquo;Why&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently attend college in a city that is ranked on this list for the most churches per capita in the world. I grew up less than a mile away from two large churches, and even a Presbyterian church to sweeten the deal. My experiences in Europe have shown me that a European mega-church usually consists of around 100 members, as opposed to the 2,000+ members that I am prone to visualize when I picture a stereotypical American mega-church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention this to illustrate that in America, people actually have options of where they choose to go to church, which is not a reality everywhere in Europe. This disparity points to the reality that there is much work to be done in exposing people to the gospel in Europe. There are so many people in Europe living a life that has never been exposed to Jesus in a personal way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The population of the Czech Republic is approximately 0.737% evangelical &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s right. Less than a percent. However, this percent has a growth rate of 0.3% per year! There are believers on the ground in this nation, and I am honored to be given the opportunity to walk alongside them for two and a half months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-posture&#34;&gt;My Posture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I was able to serve at English Camp with a Church in Český Těšín, CZ. I was coming out of a very heavy season of life, where I had just quit baseball (I had played for 13 years and gotten to the college level) and was convicted that I had used it as an means to glorify myself. I had been drawn to missions in high school before, but after coming to Wheaton, I was less mindful of it while pursuing other passions that I have since deemed as not conducive to spiritual growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was in this heavy season, one of my pastors at my church in Wheaton shared a verse with me before I left for Europe last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
(Ephesians 2:10 NASB)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I was encouraged when I heard it, I had no clue how clear this would become while I was serving. I was able to reframe missions as my participation in building the most honorable kingdom - the kingdom of God. Missions was not the passion of my past, rather it was restored as a means by which I could walk in the good works God has prepared for me. I want to accept this invitation from the Lord to partake in His masterful building plan for His kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By no means am I saying that missions is the ONLY way to walk in the good works God has prepared for me. That would be to suppose the sacred-secular divide is real, which is not true. I just know that the Holy Spirit empowered me to get excited about sharing my first love with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, I am going back. I am by no means sufficient to carry this out on my own, but I know God&amp;rsquo;s power is perfected in my weakness. I just need to act in faith and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Welcome to my blog!</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-even-is-this&#34;&gt;What even is this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a place where I plan on sharing my thoughts, experienes, and things I have found to be encouragements in my life!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why&lt;/strong&gt;: This blog is inspired by my desire to encourage people to follow Jesus. More specifically, I was inspired by a practice my church group did when we were serving in the Czech Republic through an organization called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.josiahventure.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Josiah Venture&lt;/a&gt;, where we &lt;a href=&#34;https://fbcaz.com/all-good/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; about our experiences to bring our local church body alongside us our Journey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Whom&lt;/strong&gt;: The intended audience for this blog is anyone who is partnering with me in my endeavors to share the gospel with youth. While my intended audience is limited, this blog is actually for anyone and everyone! Please join in praying for me as I prepare to spend my summer as an intern with Josiah Venture!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-you-plan-on-posting-here&#34;&gt;What do you plan on posting here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to share with you my experiences preparing for my JV summer internship, as well as my experiences during the internship. After my time in Czechía, I will be able to reflect on the things that God was showing me along the way!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I also have ambitions to publish some of my own writing here - mainly about books I want to review, ideas I want to share, and things I would love to invite you to consider!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-josiahventurehttpswwwjosiahventurecom&#34;&gt;What is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.josiahventure.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;JosiahVenture&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josiah Venture is a para-church missions organization focused on raising up youth leaders in Central and Eastern Europe. Their mission statement can be found on their website, but I&amp;rsquo;ve retrieved it here for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&#34;This is the vision of Josiah Venture, a vision for a movement of God among the youth of Central and Eastern Europe that finds its home in the local church and transforms society. Our mission and calling is to equip young leaders to fulfill Christ’s commission by reaching and making disciples. More than just conversion, we want to see passionate followers of Jesus Christ, with a vision to reach and disciple their generation for him.&#34;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heartbeat behind Josiah Venture is actually derived from the story of King Josiah of Israel (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2CH.34.ESV&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;read here&lt;/a&gt;). He inherits the throne of Israel at age eight. He did what was right in the eyes of God, purged the nation of places reserved for idol worship, and sought to reorient the people to follow God once again. As an organization, Josiah Venture seeks to find and raise up more Josiah&amp;rsquo;s across Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-will-you-be-serving&#34;&gt;How will you be serving?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be serving alongside the current Josiah Venture missionaries that are already in Czechía by partnering with local churches to promote, plan, and facilitate English Camps across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;can-you-give-me-a-preview-of-what-this-will-look-like-somehow&#34;&gt;Can you give me a preview of what this will look like somehow?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t exactly look into the future, but I imagine it will look similar to the camp I served last summer, when my church in AZ partnered with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbtesin.cz/en/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;local Czech church&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/h3TBU2FuNTE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I anticipated the questions you might have. If not, feel free to contact me with more questions via the form on the home page. I was led to create this blog in December 2022, and it is super fun to finally see it come to fruition. Glory be to God, and may this page be one that is edifying to all who read it!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My hope and prayer is that if you have chosen to let Jesus rule over your life, that you may be spurred on to love and good works (Hebrews 10:24), and that if you do not yet have Jesus as the ruler of your life, that you’d stick around for the sake of curiosity. After all, I’ll probably be posting more than just summer preparatory items on here! &lt;br&gt;
