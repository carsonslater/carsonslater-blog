      <title>10 Things I Took Away from My Summer Missionary Internship</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-announcement&#34;&gt;An Announcement!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stated on my previous post, I hosted a Zoom call on Saturday, September 2, 2023 at &lt;strong&gt;7AM Pacific Standard Time&lt;/strong&gt;. This was an opportunity to hear it from me about what the summer was like. In this call I gave a short presentation, followed by a Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not feel badly if you missed it! You can always watch the meeting by clicking &lt;a href=&#34;https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbaylor.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2Ff0lrZBWY7PbH2_pjE2DRy9AsnBBHLenAj_ACV5IoY2QnJ5sFKD62IGlErynnrfJx.kj2gq4Mb49saZLGh&amp;amp;data=05%7C01%7Ccarson_slater1%40baylor.edu%7C83f11910f7f448fbd36508dbabcfa193%7C22d2fb35256a459bbcf4dc23d42dc0a4%7C0%7C0%7C638292680478685543%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=XDhsiqgjCQcSuulqm19YjeF2gQzh%2Fe%2BwR%2FqwuBUpHzg%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and input the recording access password &lt;strong&gt;6%j##jls&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are interested in watching, I would advise you to skip to &lt;strong&gt;04:18:04&lt;/strong&gt;, as we had some people accidentally join the call too early, starting the recording with that.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ten-things-i-learnedwas-affirmed-in-this-summer&#34;&gt;Ten Things I Learned/Was Affirmed in This Summer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending a significant amount of time processing the summer, trying to recall all of the events, interactions, and encouraging things, I have concisely narrowed down ten things that God has made apparent to me in my time serving Him. Here they are with brief descriptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is definitely moving in Central and Eastern Europe. (and all over the world)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the tricky parts of doing an internship like mine is actually the post-internship reintegration. I have so many experiences that I have borne witness to God&amp;rsquo;s movement, yet I don&amp;rsquo;t want to compartmentalize God&amp;rsquo;s movement to only Central and Eastern Europe. I&amp;rsquo;d be lying if I told you that I did not want to go back to the Czech Republic as soon as possible though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God has an overarching plan for the restoration of His people that is much bigger than our individual lives. This plan is very much happening inevitably. We are invited to co-labor in this magnificent plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming into the summer, I had just taken a class on Biblical Theology at my church, and was mindful of the redemptive arc of Scripture. Then when I realized that the camps theme for the summer was `Part of the Plan,&amp;rsquo; I knew this was totally God&amp;rsquo;s way of reminding me that this redemptive arc is clearly also seen in missions.&lt;/p&gt;

















&lt;div class=&#34;gallery-grid&#34;&gt;

  
  
  
    
    
    
    
    
      
    
  
  
  &lt;div class=&#34;gallery-item gallery-item--medium&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;gallery-random&#34; href=&#34;https://carsonslater.com/media/albums/random/02-52.jpg&#34; &gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://carsonslater.com/media/albums/random/02-52_huc4acc0e82270eba68768c3e78f5261f4_4917389_750x750_fit_q75_h2_lanczos.webp&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;02-52.jpg&#34; width=&#34;750&#34; height=&#34;501&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  
    
    
    
    
    
      
    
  
  
  &lt;div class=&#34;gallery-item gallery-item--medium&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;gallery-random&#34; href=&#34;https://carsonslater.com/media/albums/random/IMG_0001.JPG&#34; &gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://carsonslater.com/media/albums/random/IMG_0001_hu8e71362f58b6a06bc7f45344af8f5687_8145948_750x750_fit_q75_h2_lanczos.webp&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_0001.JPG&#34; width=&#34;750&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be a good steward of kingdom building opportunities, we as Christians ought to do youth ministry and discipleship in our communities. This summer, I discovered the immense value of youth discipleship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is intuitive for me, but at the same time, I confess I sometimes saw youth ministry as something `second rate.&amp;rsquo; Rather, discipling the next generation is one of the most important callings of the church, and should be taken very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many scenarios in our lives, but particularly ministry, we are better off abiding than striving. Also, abiding not a necessarily a passive but rather an active posture (it takes intentionality).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of times I found myself trying to force a gospel conversation, and `coming up short&amp;rsquo; only for the conversation to happen organically a few days later was uncanny. Trying to white-knuckle and force things is not what bear fruit. In ministry, we follow God&amp;rsquo;s lead, not visa versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to learn to be a better steward of my personal bandwidth when it comes to large social environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youth ministry is high energy, and high demand! Young people are vibrant, energetic, and becoming who they are. They have tons of inquiries, anxieties and lots of zeal! I myself am not excluded from this, as I am still young, but there were still points this summer where I felt like I met my maximum bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am still broken and need healing from the Lord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need the gospel just as much as every student I encounter does! Enough said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being ‘relevant’ is not what bears fruit. Being loving is what we are called to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This takeaway is inspired by my pre-internship reading of Nouwen&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;In the Name of Jesus&lt;/em&gt;. A theme in the book was Nouwen&amp;rsquo;s honest internal struggle of being `relevant.&amp;rsquo; Ultimately, I saw this play out in real time this summer. I am not making disciples of myself. I am making disciples of Christ by loving people well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are never told to cast seeds on exclusively the ‘good soil’ we are told to sow seeds, and that is all. To believe we know the heart of others well enough to determine what kind of soil they are is arrogant and incorrect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I presuppose that success is found in `winning&amp;rsquo; people over to Jesus, then I am entirely wrong. There is a biblical basis for this. My calling as a Christian is to faithfully witness that Jesus is Lord, Savior, and friend. My faithfulness is my success. The yield that is borne because of seed I planted is something I have no control over. Hence, I am told to simply be faithful, not exclusively target the people who I think will be receptive to the gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;9&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day I do well to ask the question, ‘how can I live on mission today?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gates of hell will &lt;strong&gt;NEVER&lt;/strong&gt; prevail against the church of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so encouraged by the amount of faithful believers I met in the Czech Republic, and I am convinced with full confidence that God is able to uphold His promise to support His bride, the church. We are all United with Christ, and in Christ we have the Holy Spirit and His power in us. No force of evil can stand against that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;want-to-stay-involved-heres-how&#34;&gt;Want to Stay Involved? Here&amp;rsquo;s How.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first would be to pray! One of Josiah Venture’s core values is bold faith. I want to invite you in bold faith to pray over the ministries that happen all year-round in the Czech Republic through Josiah Venture. For up-to-date prayer requests, you can download the Josiah Venture prayer room app on your phone where you can be guided through praying over specific people and ministries all over Europe. Likewise, if you would like requests pertaining to only the people I worked with, please reach out to me at +1 (480) 320-8898 via text! These people do appear in the prayer room app, but alongside missionaries from other countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second way would be giving! If you are interested in giving, please text me and I can share with you some missionaries that I worked with this summer who are in need of more support (there are a few!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third way you can be involved is by going! If you are interested in going, I can place you in contact with a person who would be able to help you organize a trip next summer to volunteer at an English camp in the Czech Republic!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, the fourth is to pray that I can go back soon. I was hoping to go back next summer, but the nature of my graduate program looks like it will prohibit me from going. Please pray that the Lord opens a door for me to go!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tentative plans for this blog are to post less-frequently, but with thoughts about different topics I am thinking about. It might feel more academic than anything else, though I promise not to write about statistics here too extensively! If you are interested in following along still, feel free to fill out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://carsonslater.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;contact form&lt;/a&gt;, with your name, and indicated interest for the continued email updates anytime I post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://carsonslater.com/post/weeks910/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Greetings! I am so thankful for all of you. I am writing this blog post (as well as every subsequent post) from Waco, Texas. I finished my internship with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.josiahventure.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Josiah Venture&lt;/a&gt; on August 10, but have since flown to Phoenix, packed up everything I own and moved to Waco, and visited some friends in Arkansas who I met at my first English Camp this summer! So if this update feels far removed from the prior, it is because there has been a lot of time since my last post. Thanks for your thoughts and prayers, and stay tuned as I unpack more of my summer for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;important-announcement&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Announcement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am hosting a Zoom call on Saturday, September 2, 2023 at &lt;strong&gt;7AM Pacific Standard Time&lt;/strong&gt;. This is an opportunity to hear it from me about what the summer was like. In this call I&amp;rsquo;ll give a short presentation, followed by a Q&amp;amp;A. There might be an appearance from my fellow interns Lydia Hanilton (Ireland) and Petr Cvejn (Czech)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mission-team-training&#34;&gt;Mission Team Training&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you&amp;rsquo;ve last heard from me, there has been a lot of things that have conspired. One of those bitter-sweet things has been our final mission team training of the summer! We were situated at a hotel north of Prague for a few days, where we hosted two churches and their mission teams preparing them for English camp. One of the most fun parts of this internship has been meeting people from all over the U.S. who partnered with Josiah Venture and came to mission team training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;camp-with-the-churches&#34;&gt;Camp with the Churches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These churches were hosting their first ever English camp ever! This made camp a vastly different experience than the prior two camps, where the churches we partnered with had been doing English camps for at least 7 years. Rather than joining this church in ministry, it felt at points we were inviting them into the ministry with the way we were doing things while showing the young believers how things at camp work. I say that it felt this way but in actuality, they were truly inviting us into ministry in their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;relationships&#34;&gt;Relationships&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could say this symbiotic dynamic was refreshing, but honestly the biggest challenge I faced at camp was maintaining high energy levels to be present in every moment. It was truly an opportunity to entrust to the Lord the relationships I was forming. My personal bandwidth was approaching its limit throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, this camp was so fun! It was my first week this whole summer that I taught English and it was so much more fun than I remember it being! Members of my class at the end of camp told one of the missionaries we were with that it was a highlight of camp!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the privilege of hanging out with students who had been displaced by the war in Ukraine at this camp, and it was remarkable to try to model Christ for them in the week that I had! We connected over small things, like high fives, Fortnite dances, and games at camp. For those students, their Czech was amazing, but their English was very poor (one of them told me they learned Czech in just five months - crazy!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two particular students I was really encouraged by were the students who were the Czech believers (names obfuscated for confidentiality). James was 18 years old, and one of the first questions he asked me thirty minutes into our relationship was my take on why bad things happen to good people. It was a fruitful conversation, and it basically set the tone for our relationship the whole week. Beyond intense questions discussed, we built on similar senses of humor, and I was able to empower him to investigate his big questions and use resources at his fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one I was encouraged by was Riley, who was actually an older camper who had a hunger for Christian community. He was an amazing athlete who was creating culture in his community through spikeball. I am thankful for connecting with him and excited to see how God uses his giftings in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-i-saw-god-moving&#34;&gt;How I Saw God Moving&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this camp is definitely a situation where I will not see fruit borne until years in the future, but the fact that I was able to join this church and train them on how to do a Josiah Venture English camp was an amazing opportunity and a huge honor. This camp was particularly difficult to navigate spiritually, as many students were not believers. We were trying to love them as Christ would, and part of that was leaning into opportunities to share the gospel with them at evening program. At this camp I was able to give a camp talk about who Jesus is, and also share my testimony the last full day of camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you share the gospel and people&amp;rsquo;s hearts are softened, and other times their hearts are calloused. This camp definitely felt like there were a lot more students in the latter circumstance, but it was interesting because they loved our staff as people. Though students were not agreeable to the gospel, we were able to love them as Christ loved us throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Praise God, because a lot of the people shared with me that the word preached that morning was very impactful for them, especially the younger people in the church. It was a cool opportunity for God to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this camp was by far the most taxing camp all summer, because of the responsibilities that fell on me, but it was also so rewarding! Praise God I was able to be a part of it and I want to invite you to join me in praying for next year&amp;rsquo;s English camp, and for Josiah Venture to send a short term mission team to support these churches next year. Thanks for keeping up with the blog and stay tuned for the next post about the last few days of my internship!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a part of an English camp is such a rich, yet taxing experience&amp;hellip; Being a part of three English camps is even more rich, yet taxing. So as interns, we spent an entire day just sleeping&amp;hellip; Which was warranted, and then we crafted a tradition of hitting up a Nepalese restaurant before each camp!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mission-team-training&#34;&gt;Mission Team Training&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mission team training was such a joy! This was our second session of the summer, so the good news is that there was not a lot that needed to be prepared ahead of time for this training. The other news is that for myself, mission team trainings have proved to be exhausting times. During these trainings, I generally have more responsibilities throughout the day, and for a lot of evening program I tend to be doing something (ranging from leading the camp dance, to doing skits and icebreakers). I had to learn how to steward my energy well during this time. Please pray for this next training this week, that I can steward my energy well! There needs to be a balance between conserving my energy for camp, and leaning into the mission teams to encourage them for their ministry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;english-camp&#34;&gt;English Camp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular English Camp was special to me because of how familiar it was for me. It was also at the same place as mission team training, which was really convenient! This exact camp was the first Josiah Venture camp I was a part of last summer, and is one of the reasons I heavily considered doing this internship. Unlike the first camp, I was surrounded by not only people from my own home (the Family Bible Church American team), but also many of the campers had returned from last year&amp;rsquo;s camp! Additionally, I noticed a few campers who had come from the school that I visited a few weeks ago in the same region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last camp was in the region of northeast Bohemia, but this camp is in a very unique region of the Czech Republic called Silesia. This particular region has a unique history because it has been fought over by Czechs, Austrians, and Poles for centuries. Currently, it is Czech, but many people speak Czech, Polish, and a language called Po našymu. It is a language that combines Czech, Slovakian, German and Polish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was so good to serve alongside the familiar faces, and experience even a different culture within the Czech Republic. For some campers, I picked up right where I left off. For this camp, there were some students I knew were not believers, so it was good to talk to them about the gospel again to see how their attitudes had developed toward it after a year. Although these conversations were rich, many of these students still seemed hardened to it. I began to focus more on investing in relationships with the Czech leaders about halfway through the week, to empower and encourage them to continue to follow up with the non-yet-saved students after camp! Please pray for them as they continue in their ministry throughout the year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;spiritual-warfare&#34;&gt;Spiritual Warfare&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both camps this summer have been filled with forthright spiritual warfare. Satan for whatever reason is not trying to hide what he is doing. This particular camp was difficult for the leadership team due to constant news of health issues for close friends and family. Though this blog is not the place to share all of the details, there were a few prayer sessions throughout the week that we as a team were able to have. It was amazing to see God providing peace to those affected! In retrospect, these were not distractions but opportunities to trust in the Lord in the midst of our service!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;epické-vzpomínky-epic-memories&#34;&gt;Epické Vzpomínky (Epic Memories)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This camp was so fun to be a part of for a second time! My discussion group was full of students from the church, so it was good to challenge them with slightly deeper questions about the evening talks. We even came up with a group name, called &amp;ldquo;the freezer,&amp;rdquo; as we claimed to be the &amp;ldquo;coolest&amp;rdquo; discussion group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there were so many fun things we partook in - a hike to summit the tallest mountain in the region, a water day, a waterfall hike, many sports and English classes, a functional fitness workshop led by yours truly, a head-to-head soccer game with another English camp, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that this ministry is one part of a church&amp;rsquo;s annual ministry. For that reason, I see it as an extremely valueable outreach event for students in their community. Not only is it a place where students can hear the gospel for the first time, but it is also a place where students who have never been connected with the mládež (youth group) can build relationships with those who are a part of the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was amazing to see God moving in the hearts of the students who had come for the first time. If I had to pick a highlight, it would either be that or reconnecting with some of the student leaders from the CB church in Český Těšín.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;photo-dump&#34;&gt;Photo Dump&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re probably wondering why I even had a photo dump, considering how many were in this blog post, but alas, here it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;camp-photo-dumphttpsphotosappgoogld8dn6ysluk7bgrwm7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://photos.app.goo.gl/D8dN6YSLuK7bgRwM7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Camp Photo Dump&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;prayer-requests&#34;&gt;Prayer Requests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some prayer requests!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My energy levels are running low, and I would love prayer for energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please pray for an ability to continue to love students as Christ would.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please pray for there to be easy opportunities to engage the word of God in this next term!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please pray for the students attending the next camp who have never heard the gospel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This camp is being put on by a church who has never done an English camp! Pray for the church and the Czech team helping us put on the camp!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a few more mission teams coming for three more camps in the Czech Republic this summer! Pray for these churches and their mission teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pray for my fellow Josiah Venture team, as we all still have any responsibilities for the rest of the summer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pray for me as I will be giving some camp talks at the next camp! Pray for the gospel to be faithfully preached!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pray for me also as I will be preaching at the church in Neratovice (north of Prague) on August 6!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for supporting my ministry through your interest and prayer! Let me know if there are things you need prayer for so I can stay involved in your lives!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! I am so tardy on this blog post and I apologize greatly. Thank you for your patience. These past two weeks have been phenomenal, and I have so much to unpack for you all. Hang tight for the sequence of events!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mission-team-training&#34;&gt;Mission Team Training&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 27, we arrived back at Josiah Venture&amp;rsquo;s training center near Frydlant, CZ at Malenovice. We were joined by four mission teams from different parts of the United States where they were given tips and
protocol for how to do life well at camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We taught them how to teach English well, lead discussion groups, understand Czech culture, and handle potential camp issues. Each day consisted of seminars, camp dance practice, workshops, free time, and the infamous evening program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who have never worked with Josiah Venture before, evening program is the climax of each day at camp, where there are high-energy songs, games, dances, skits, all building up to an evening talk with a gospel presentation. At mission team training, we put on our own evening program where we gave mission teams a glimpse into what each evening would look like for them at camp. As an intern, most of the things in evening program are my responsibility, minus the talk, so that was probably my most busiest time during training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall mission team training was great because I was able to bond with the mission teams, especially the one I tagged along to do camp with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;arriving-at-camp&#34;&gt;Arriving at Camp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 30, we hopped on a train for 5 hours to where camp was, which was near the CB church in Bystre. For context, Bystre is in the northeast part of Bohemia, and so it is kind of in the center of the Czech Republic but more north. The American team typically arrives at camp a day or so before camp actually starts to set up the campground, and make final preparations. One of my responsibilities was to help make the &lt;a href=&#34;https://photos.app.goo.gl/TcDprFpt4qW8sTC2A&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;camp rules video&lt;/a&gt;. (You should watch it!) We ended up making a parody of a-ha&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Take on Me&lt;/em&gt;. This video was played during the first evening program to highlight the do&amp;rsquo;s and don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo;s of camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;camp-highlights&#34;&gt;Camp Highlights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Czech church people, this was the most students they had ever had for English camp! There were almost 70 students. Each day of camp, students could sign up for a morning activity, which could be either English class, a music workshop, a hike, or a sports activity. After lunch, there were different afternoon workshops containing games, useful skills, or talks. There was always an afternoon activity which involved team games, or water-activities, and evening program started after dinner. After each evening program, the whole camp split into discussion groups to process the content of the evening talk, and finally there was always a night time activity starting at 10pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For myself, I mostly led the morning sports workshops, but one morning I was asked to lead the music workshop! Of all the sports workshops, the Czechs seemed to enjoy the American sports the most (baseball and American football).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afternoon workshops were a blast! From cooking workshops by a masterchef competitor, to a workshops on how to travel well, to crocheting, we offered a lot of different options for the students to gain random useful skills. One afternoon workshop I hosted was a specialty coffee workshop. The camp director had me and a local coffee barista come and teach people how to think about, buy, and brew specialty coffee! It was super cool and I actually learned a few new brewing methods from my Czech coffee counterpart, although I must say he was far more advanced than me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular English camp really impressed me with all of the creativity that went into planning the afternoon activities, we did fun minigames, but we also had thematic games, such as the squid games (based off the Netflix series) and a game based off the 10 plagues of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evening programs were super energetic. The students I talked to all agreed that the camp dance was one of the most fun and energizing parts of camp. We also had the camp songs, led by yours truly and my fellow intern Lydia. Worship followed camp songs, which led up to each evening talk.&lt;/p&gt;

      First evening program of the week!!!
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the camp theme is &amp;ldquo;Part of the Plan,&amp;rdquo; and all of the camp talks go through part of the redemptive arc of Scripture, starting in Genesis, and ending in the church age. Each evening, there is a different main topic, ranging from God&amp;rsquo;s created design, to sin, to how God wants to restore hearts to follow Him. Each talk is followed by a discussion group time where students are given an opportunity to unpack what they thought about the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God was moving all week, even in times when it did not seem clear to me! We had three of the eight girls in my discussion group give their lives to Jesus for the first time! Also in another group, a 13 year old boy who had been the quietest, most reserved kid at camp, gave his life to Jesus for the first time as well after our Labyrinth exhibition (series of interactive exhibitions that students walk through to process the gospel)! That next day he seemed like a completely different person. He was dancing - like everywhere. The joy was contagious. Also - it turns out that he started to speak - NEARLY FLUENT ENGLISH! He went from not talking at all to having full-fledged conversations with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more student came up to me at one of the evening activities where she shared with me that before camp, she was running away from God, even though her whole family are Christians. She told me that because of some important words from a few people, she wants to repent and turn. Please pray for her as she navigates this change of heart!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evening activities created some of the most fun memories at camp. We had games, a talent show, a fourth of July party, and an Egypt party. Those were times where I felt like the strongest bonds were forged between the students and Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;one-more-story&#34;&gt;One More Story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the week, I learned that one of the students in my room who was staying with me was very agnostic. I learned this after talking with him about books, because I had asked him one day during free time what he was reading. I loved this conversation because I promised to read one of his favorite books, and he promised to read &lt;em&gt;Mere Christianity&lt;/em&gt; by C.S. Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the course of the week and at meal times, I would see him and continue to invest in the relationship, asking him questions about his life at university (he was an engineering student), and his hometown, and his hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually learned that he has had a few open heart surgeries, with one being as recent as the past year. I asked him if the evening talks or discussion groups resonated with him, and he did not seem to think so. I proposed that perhaps it was a part of God&amp;rsquo;s plan that he was at English camp. He did not seem to think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night of Labyrinth, I again got to chat with him for an hour! We talked about how he percieved the activity, and he seemed to be very respectful, even impressed by our belief in God, but he himself did not buy in because he was not sure anyone could know for sure. Then I asked him the following question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think you would accept as evidence for God&amp;rsquo;s existence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out the question was something he had never considered before. Many people who do not believe in God do not realize that when they have no standard for evidence, they are in denial. They aren&amp;rsquo;t giving God a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question had stumped him. The conversation lasted another thirty minutes, containing more questions, a retelling of the story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman at the well, and a promise to follow up on the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed up by continuing this conversation at breakfast on the last day of camp. This student&amp;rsquo;s discussion group leader later told me that this conversation was one of the biggest takeaways he had at camp! He loved thinking about God, and although he never trusted Jesus, him and I are still in touch, and will be reading the books we promised each other we&amp;rsquo;d read! Please pray that God continues to work on this student&amp;rsquo;s heart this summer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a joy to serve alongside the people at the Czech Church, CB Bystre, and also the American church, Fellowship Bible Church in Conway, AR. The team was young, energetic, and I am so excited to go visit them when I get back to the states! This camp would not have gone as well without them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the war in Ukraine to end promptly and for people there to begin rebuilding their lives and healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the 9 remaining English camps happening across the Czech Republic this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the students who accepted Christ for the first time this past week at English Camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;safe travel for mission teams heading home, and heading to Czechia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Czech leaders to trust the Lord in their camps, and have all the logistical things run smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the communities and churches hosting these English Camps, that they would be inviting places where new students would want to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my energy levels as I am entering my second camps term.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Camp Season is Upon Us!</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;camp-season-is-upon-us&#34;&gt;Camp season is upon us!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this, there are three mission teams en route to Krakow, Poland, where they will be greeted by JV missionaries who are ready to take them to their mission team training! As an intern, responsibilities at mission team training is a huge part of my job. I am so excited to get the ball rolling! Before we cover that, I should recap my week for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;garden-party&#34;&gt;Garden Party&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I may be a Josiah Venture intern, I am actually working for an organization called KAM (Křesťanská Akademie Mladých - Christian Youth Academy), which is one of the many national organizations under Josiah Venture. For the past few summers, KAM has had a small get-together where all of the Czech national missionaries meet at the Josiah Venture conference center. This was actually a really refreshing experience for me, as I got to meet a TON of missionaries that serve here in Czechia, and I got to hear story after story of how God has moved in their lives. Although the gathering was only for an evening, I had so much fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      Catching up with Josh Dietz at Garden Party.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three people I really was excited to talk with were &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.josiahventure.com/people-and-places/czech-republic/4089&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Josh Dietz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.josiahventure.com/people-and-places/czech-republic/3759&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Brad Kaspar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.josiahventure.com/people-and-places/czech-republic/6509&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tomáš Zářický&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh was my initial JV connection, so it is always good to see him and catch up. Brad Kaspar tapped me on the shoulder, seeing I was wearing a Wheaton shirt, and told me he was a class of &amp;lsquo;02 alumni! That was a really cool experience, and I got to hear his story and share mine with him. He moved to Czechia as a single missionary in 2005, and he continues to serve in regional work with his wife! Lastly, I met Tomáš Zářický at intern training, and he has been the biggest hype man. His energy is unmatched and so appreciated. I enjoyed getting to chat with him again and pray for him (he might be going to Ukraine to do camps later this summer)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a Czechia intern for JV has its perks, and one of them is that we are close to all of the main Josiah Venture people. They all live here on the east side of Czechia! For most intern teams, they are the only ones in their countries, but we Czech camp interns have been able to bond with the JV communications interns!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our last get-together happened this past week, because four of the six of them left on a long trip to visit JV camps all over Europe to create content and capture moments from the summer. We had such a good time with them though!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For church on Sunday, it was so great to visit the church who my home church partners with, CB Český Těšín! I got to see my home-stay visit family from last year, and I got to connect with lots of people who will be at our second English camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-preparations&#34;&gt;Final Preparations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camp is on the horizon, and from here on out, the summer is going to look a lot more fast-paced! As far as I know, we interns are ready for mission team training, and also for camp! I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get ahead in the work that I need to do, preparing devotionals and icebreaker games, but there is only so much we can do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;prayer-requests&#34;&gt;Prayer Requests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love if you joined us in our ministry by praying over us! Some things that we would love you to join us in petitioning the Lord for are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For mission team training to serve its purpose in preparing the teams to do a long week and a half of camp ministry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That God may continue to purify our hearts from day to day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That we as interns can integrate well into the various camp leadership teams and structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For strength, energy and focus during the fast-paced nature of our internship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For wisdom in navigating gospel conversations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For students to have an open heart toward the gospel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That we as interns may be effective in meeting students where they are at, to love on them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I have so many photos to share! I&amp;rsquo;ll pick some key ones to showcase on the page, but you can visit the album directly below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Father, make of me a crisis man. Bring those I contact to decision. Let me not be a milepost on a single road; make me a fork, that men must turn one way or another on facing Christ in me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I alluded in my last post, this week was full of travel! I think I have gone on 12 train rides in the past 7 days (Europe is kind of epic for having infrastructure like this). We three amigos (the Czech interns - or Czechterns hehe) met so many amazing people to touch base with before we do camp with all of them in a few weeks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-god-is-moving-in-my-heart&#34;&gt;How God is Moving in My Heart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I failed to mention this in the last post, but I got to work out with JV Edge Sports leader, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.josiahventure.com/people-and-places/czech-republic/3868/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Casey Yorman&lt;/a&gt; in his garage the previous two Mondays. During our last lift, he was gracious enough to ask me how I saw God meeting me during this time in Czechia. As a verbal processor, it was a prime opportunity to process what God was doing, and I&amp;rsquo;d love to share it with you here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming into the internship, I was in the midst of a LOT of transition. Undergrad had just ended for me - many close friends were shot like arrows all over the world to do kingdom work. Realities I thought were going to be the case ended up not working out, and there was a lot of brokenness in the circumstances around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that brokenness God met me and He reminded me that my suffering was a means to make me more whole. Through my emotional suffering, God helped me love Him more, drawing me to Himself. His love was the only thing I could certainly cling to. He proved to be my &amp;lsquo;rock.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God did more than remind me of His promises. When I sought the Lord, I was reminded of His heart for creation, and how He wants to restore it! He gave me a glimpse into His heart and enabled me to take on the same posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so God not only reminded me of His promises and how He is making all things new, but also He &lt;strong&gt;INVITES&lt;/strong&gt; me into that renewal process as a co-laborer. This is the highest honor, and my internship experience has made this so apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;říčany-visit&#34;&gt;Říčany Visit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Říčany is a north suburb about 30 minutes north of Prague via train. We were able to go into the grammar school there, and promote English camp just as we did in Český Těšín. Students there were so lively - praise God! I was even asked several times, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re an American, what are you doing in Říčany?&amp;rdquo; I love this question, because it gives me an opportunity to share the gospel. I even got to share why I am in Czechia in a school visit class!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We them met up with the pastor of their church, and met two of the youth group members which was very excited. We have fellowship over barbecue, which made me very excited to do camp with them (not because of the BBQ, in case you were wondering).&lt;/p&gt;

      Getting to know one of the youth group members from Neratovice!
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Říčany school visit, we were able to stay with the pastor of the Neratovice church (30 mins south of Prague), who was so hospitable! We had school visits the next day, and the students were very intrigued by the idea of English camp, because they haven&amp;rsquo;t had one in their region for a long time (or ever?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were asked by the pastor to lead the youth group that same night, because he and his family needed to attend a funeral. God knew what He was doing, because we decided to play some icebreaker games, worship together, and have a discussion on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bible.com/bible/59/LUK.15.ESV&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Luke 15:1-7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the students (who are not believers) were attending the group for the first time, and they had told my fellow intern Lydia that at our group was the first time they had ever read the Bible. What an honor it was to introduce the students to Scripture for the first time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bystre-visit&#34;&gt;Bystre Visit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we were able to go to youth group (in Czechia, youth group is called &amp;ldquo;mladez&amp;rdquo;) for Petr&amp;rsquo;s home church in Bystre where we will be doing our first camp. It was great to connect with the youth at that church, because we have a relational foundation to start with before we begin camp.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were treated with much kindness and hospitality at Bystre, and discussed ideas for the camp. Sunday in Bystre was also a joy, where we got to stand up in the service and share our excitement for camp. We invited the congregation to pray for camp, and for God to draw people to Himself. I&amp;rsquo;d love to invite you into the same thing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;prep-for-camp&#34;&gt;Prep for Camp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upcoming we have a one-day JV-Czech (KAM) conference, followed by five more days to prepare for camp. I will be preparing devotionals, English camp materials, ice-breaker games, worship sets, and resting during this time! Camp season is intense, so please pray that our team can communicate, collaborate, and rest well during the camps. We want to be fresh to build relationships and lean into gospel conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love if you joined us in our ministry by praying over us! Some things that we would love you to join us in petitioning the Lord for are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the Lord may bring more students to English camps through our school visits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That God may continue to purify our hearts from day to day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That we as interns can integrate well into the various camp leadership teams and structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For wisdom in navigating gospel conversations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For students to have an open heart toward the gospel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That we as interns may be effective in meeting students where they are at, to love on them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I have so many photos to share! I have had the problem of picking which ones to showcase on the blog, but I think I have found the solution. I&amp;rsquo;ll pick some key ones to showcase on the page, but you can visit the album directly below:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Week of Preparation</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;please-pray-for-ukraine-&#34;&gt;Please Pray for Ukraine 🇺🇦&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howdy everyone! I know I am doing ministry in Czechia this summer, but I wanted to ask you to please pray for Ukraine as a nation right now. There is a lot of distress, damage and ministry going on there right now! Men from 18-50 are being drafted every day to fight in the war, and we would do well as Christians to pray for them as they experience oppression. Pray that the Russians would relent from their agenda, and for the people in Russia as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;life-in-ostrava&#34;&gt;Life in Ostrava&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next month, my home base has become a dormitory in Ostrava, the third biggest city in the Czech Republic. Lots of the JV missionaries live in Ostrava but do ministry all over the surrounding region of Moravia and Silesia. We, as interns are no exception. This week has been nice to get our feet underneath us, but we have been doing lots of preparation for camp. Lots of my free time has been devoted to prepping English class materials for all three levels (Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced). Other time has been spent brainstorming ice-breaker games, crafting devotionals, and doing intern team-building exercises. We even had a CliftonStrengths Strengthfinders consulting session with a certified coach, who happens to be my intern director&amp;rsquo;s wife!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;school-visits&#34;&gt;School Visits!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, we traveled to Český Těšín, where we taught six forty-five minute class periods of English basics in the public school. We led games and also promoted camp with flyers, and I even got to share a presentation of where I am from - Arizona! The students were particularly interested in the pictures I had of the desert landscape, because it is so different than the landscape here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rest-day&#34;&gt;Rest Day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday was our rest day, where we took a team trip to the mountains of Slovakia! There we hiked through beautiful ravines, and rock crevices. It was green and a very refreshing time with the team (literally - it rained!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;more-preparation&#34;&gt;More Preparation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This upcoming week we are hitting the road to promote camp on the other side of the country. Our third camp this summer is being hosted by two churches working together in the Prague area, and it will be the first year they have ever done an English Camp! As a result, we will be much more hands-on with this English Camp and have to walk the church through what doing one of these camps look like. They have smaller youth groups, but we are hoping the school visits in their areas on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday will get students in their communities excited about English Camp. So, Tuesday is another administrative day (prepping for teaching English does take many hours) where we will be gearing up for English classes and the upcoming school visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also be preparing for Mission Team Training, where we will train the short-term American teams that are coming to support these English Camps.

&lt;li&gt;There are many logistical things that are still unresolved about our summer. Pray that God would help us steward our time here well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pray that God will show us a faster and more effective way to prepare for English classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanking God that our team is really growing closer together and more comfortable with each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pray that our local churches with whom we are partnering can prepare for English camps well. Especially the churches near Prague!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pray for the American mission teams that are coming to our English camps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pray for students to have an open heart toward the gospel.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Quite an &#39;Amazing&#39; Start</title>
      <link>https://carsonslater.com/post/week1/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;ready-set-go&#34;&gt;Ready, Set, Go!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived at the airport in Krakow, Poland with one of my fellow interns, Petr, a JV Czech staff member, Baru, and my intern director, Josh, via bus on Thursday, June 1st. There we met up with our final team member Lydia who flew in from northern Ireland! From there, we started on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2edwpFxpg8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;JV Amazing Race&lt;/a&gt;, which took us throughout the city of Krakow. We encountered challenges that were designed to build up team chemistry, uncover strengths and weaknesses of individuals, and teach us about Josiah Venture and Polish culture. After spending the night in a Krakow hostel and running through some obstacles Friday in Krakow, we took a bus to Český Těšín, where we finished the race (I felt like I had home court advantage low key).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you were wondering, we were in eighth place out of fourteen after day 1, and finished in fifth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some noteworthy race features were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding specific plants in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ogrod.uj.edu.pl/english&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Botanical Garden of the Jagiellonian University&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Riding the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cracoweye.pl/en/home-english/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Krakow Eye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Puzzles regarding famous Polish music composer&amp;rsquo;s Chopin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/2MSgFefjK0T7Iwjvr3OKqV?si=c69a8da111be40c5&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nocturne No.20 in C sharp minor&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An epic scavenger hunt all over Krakow, with many items requiring us to talk to strangers,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking a picture from the overlook at Těšín,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning how to wash clothes in a sink in Český Těšín,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning the camp dance,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall this race was an opportunity for me to gel with my intern team, and I am so thankful for the memorable experience. Running and debriefing it was a huge opportunity to set ourselves up for success over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the race, I &amp;lsquo;ran into&amp;rsquo; one of the elders from my Arizona church, Doug Sandy! That was super cool. Doug was the leader of my first trip to Czechia last summer, and he was visiting the church we did our camp with last summer as a short-term team.&lt;/p&gt;

      Intern training at Malenovice!
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d be dishonest if I said that intern training was a breeze. There were many challenges that presented themselves that were opportunities to rely on the Lord. While learning about various topics like the gospel in Europe, team dynamics, culture, healthy conflict resolution, and intern expectations, God was preparing me emotionally to lean on Him this whole summer. Praise God for His subtle (or not so subtle) ways of reminding us of Christ&amp;rsquo;s supremacy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw God moving in the hearts of the interns around me too. There were so many fruitful discussions where other interns were able to share their excitements and concerns about the summer ahead of them in their respective countries. I made a few more friends too at intern training, some of whom I will be praying for throughout the whole summer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-am-i-feeling-heading-into-ministry&#34;&gt;How am I feeling heading into ministry?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a perfectionist, I know I will never be &amp;lsquo;ready&amp;rsquo; in the sense that I feel most secure; however, I was itching to engage youth and students by the end of intern training. I am so excited for the coming weeks as I prepare for camps, visit schools to promote camps, and encourage local long-term missionaries! I pray that God may go prepare the way for us as our camps teams prepare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The gospel also reminds me that my righteous standing with God always holds firm regardless of my performance, because my standing is based solely on the work of Jesus and not mine. On my worst days of sin and failure, the gospel encourages me with God’s unrelenting grace toward me. On my best days of victory and usefulness, the gospel keeps me relating to God solely on the basis of Jesus’ righteousness and not mine.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prayer-requests&#34;&gt;Prayer Requests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love if you joined us in our ministry by praying over us! Some things that we would love you to join us in petitioning the Lord for are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the Lord may bring more students to English camps through our school visits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That our team may continue to gel together and build up one another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That our local churches with whom we are partnering can prepare for English camps well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the American mission teams that are coming to our English camps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For students to have an open heart toward the gospel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That we as interns may be effective in meeting students where they are at, to love on them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thank-you&#34;&gt;Thank You!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this, I want to THANK YOU!!! Your support and prayer means so much to me! Let me know if there are any ways I can be praying for you via tha contact form on the home page!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Model of Discipleship</title>
      <link>https://carsonslater.com/post/discipleship/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2023 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://carsonslater.com/post/discipleship/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I visited the Czech Republic for the first time, and it was a great experience. We partnered with a church near the Polish border and helped with their annual English Camp. Thankfully, we did not just dive straight into the camp, unprepared. We did months of preparation on the front end of the trip, and even a couple days of training in Prague upon arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our training, we were not only given time to overcome jet lag, but we were also introduced to Josiah Venture&amp;rsquo;s discipleship training material. I thought it would be helpful to share it with you all since it is the abstract paradigm through which I will be operating this summer as I minister to high school students!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a disclaimer, the first two of these challenges first happen to people who have not yet repented and believed (i.e. nonbelievers). Every person who is in Christ encounters these five challenges in their life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-five-challenges-of-christ&#34;&gt;The Five Challenges of Christ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so obviously Jesus gave more than five challenges to disciples and others alike during the incarnation, but this framework has been what Josiah Venture has been using to train others to disciple during their camps ministry. I have found it very digestible, actionable, and easy to remember. I think it is cool too because I see parallels between Jesus&amp;rsquo;s words in Scripture and a Biblical Theology of Mission (spoiler alert).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-come-and-see&#34;&gt;1. Come and See&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first chapter of John, before Jesus began His ministry, we saw Him calling men to look at and entertain what He was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;[Jesus] said to them, &amp;lsquo;Come and you will see.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus (God incarnate) was drawing people to Himself. Is this new? Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about ancient Israel! They had a &amp;rsquo;limited&amp;rsquo; mission - to be a covenant community designed to mediate the presence of God on a sinful and rebellious earth. Israel did not reject foreigners dwelling among them, insofar as these foreigners did not lead the Israelites astray, but they were certainly not evangelistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for discipleship in my life to take place, I must first come and see what God is doing. How can I give a reason for the hope that is within me, if I have not begun personally witness what the Lord is doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-repent-and-believe&#34;&gt;2. Repent and Believe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipleship does not stop with acknowledging God. Anyone who is in Christ is a new creation! When Jesus came to earth, He began His ministry saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe the gospel.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this mysterious &amp;lsquo;kingdom&amp;rsquo; language Jesus is using? Why is it grounds to repent and believe the gospel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is because the kingdom life is the life Jesus himself embodied and inaugurated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, Jesus could say that &amp;rsquo;the kingdom of God is at hand&amp;rsquo; because &lt;em&gt;He&lt;/em&gt; was standing in their midst. Jesus not only made the perfect atonement for the sin of humanity, but He also embodied the lives God designed His people to live. Because the embodiment of the kingdom life was at hand, the kingdom of God was also at hand by extension. This is why when He started his ministry, He invited people to take on this kingdom life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for us to take on this new life, repentance is necessary. A godly sorrow for sin, and a turning away from things that displease God are key components of this. A bold faith in the truth and power of the gospel is of equal importance. Only then, when I understand what life with and in Christ means, can I begin to show others what it is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-follow-me&#34;&gt;3. Follow Me&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As Jesus went on from there, He saw a man called Matthew, sitting in the tax collector’s booth; and He said to him, &amp;lsquo;Follow Me!&amp;rsquo; And he got up and followed Him. Then it happened that as Jesus was reclining at the table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were dining with Jesus and His disciples.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repentance and belief in the gospel are not a single, one-time events. Perhaps you can argue that the &lt;em&gt;resolution&lt;/em&gt; to repent and believe in the gospel is, but repentance and belief are daily decisions. When someone consistently makes the daily decision to repent and believe in the gospel with a genuine sincerity, one can say they are following Jesus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Jesus requires faithfulness. This component of faithfulness pertains to steadfastness. We can be faithful in one sense, where we believe in the gospel, but we can also be faithful in the other sense, where we had steadfast, unwavering belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this phase a person begins to understand what life with God truly looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-fish-for-men&#34;&gt;4. Fish for Men&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I too can invite people to &amp;lsquo;come and see&amp;rsquo; what God is doing &amp;ndash; both on a personal and corporate level. This is one way we can mediate the presence of God on earth, as His royal priesthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And [Jesus] said to them, &amp;lsquo;Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This invitation to &amp;lsquo;fish for men,&amp;rsquo; is a challenge to invite people to come and see, repent and believe, and follow Jesus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite examples in Scripture of this is the first four of these challenges in action, demonstrated in two verses. Paul writes to Timothy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You then, my child, be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus, and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is precisely the verse we used to name the podcast that my friends started at my church in Arizona (shameless plug - click &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/show/2nwcHPoB5bOc9wJOqAp62O?si=92d9bdf720384c3f&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to listen on Spotify)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this idea of entrusting what we know about follow God to others new? Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s check out Deuteronomy 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You shall therefore lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and you shall bind them as a sign in your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you are sitting in your house, and when you are walking by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a new idea! Propagation of the truth and kingdom life amongst humanity is a key part of God&amp;rsquo;s plan to restore Creation. Fishing for men plays a critical role in this plan!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-send-them-out&#34;&gt;5. Send Them Out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the resurrection, Jesus visited His disciples, and He said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last challenge Jesus has with respect to discipleship is to send your disciples out. Just as we were once sent, we also need to send out those whom we have walked with. This challenge gives us all the more reason to train them up in the way they should go, because they will need to be equipped with a robust understanding of the things of God, and more importantly, a deep love for Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this post gives you a glimpse into what things we are trained to do in our internship. To be honest, this material was mostly things I digested last summer on my short-term trip, with a little bit of extra synthesis on my part. Hopefully, you gleaned something from this post, and are able to implement this into your life!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today marks day one of my summer in Europe! It as been quite a crazy couple of weeks for myself. I aspired to write a few posts between when I posted my last one and now; however, perpetual circumstance in this season of transition did not relent. Here are a few moments I was able to be a part of in the past couple of weeks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two beautiful weddings for some of my favorite people!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My own undergraduate commencement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My sister&amp;rsquo;s high school graduation (shout out to Carolyn).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tender coversations with friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packing up everything I own to prepare to move to Texas after my JV internship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels as though my college graduation was yesterday, but at the same time, I was itching to get on the plane to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;god-is-moving&#34;&gt;God is moving.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my post-grad time has been short and I have scarcely had time to process and reflect, here are some things that God has been laying on my heart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suffering and joy are intuitively thought of as inversely proportional. Although suffering does not ellicit a joyful response in of itself, there is a perspective toward suffering we obtain once we are united with Christ that shows us that it is God&amp;rsquo;s workmanship perfecting us, making us whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lately, I have been learning how to grieve well!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My missionary summer internship is &lt;strong&gt;so significant, but not ultimate&lt;/strong&gt;. It is also a part of God&amp;rsquo;s greater plan to redeem and restore humanity, just like your workday, or your friendships! We have a role to play in the main story, but we are not the main story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This summer will be an amazing learning experience. I am so excited!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to abide in Christ, as I am united with Him in His death and resurrection. &lt;em&gt;Perichoresis&lt;/em&gt; is the theological term for how the persons of the trinity relates to each other. It is though of as a dance - I too want to dance with God in this beautiful, messy, but calculated manner, letting him lead me. My salvation is my invitation into this dance with God!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-ahead&#34;&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon touchdown in Prague I will (Lord willing) be picked up by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.josiahventure.com/people-and-places/czech-republic/4089&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Josh Dietz&lt;/a&gt;, my original connection to Josiah Venture, and I will hop on a train to Ostrava, Czechia. After spending the night with my intern director, I will head to Krakow on a bus to start the Josiah Venture Amazing Race, a part of intern training! Stay tuned for fun stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-invitation-to-prayer&#34;&gt;An Invitation to Prayer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to invite you to prayer over:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My intern team as we learn how to encourage one another and work as a team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My intern director, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.josiahventure.com/people-and-places/czech-republic/3876&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Josh Nelson&lt;/a&gt;, as he will be leading us the whole summer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The camps ministry for Josiah Venture, and all of the students who are going to be coming to camp!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for partnering with me in my summer missionary internship!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-have-great-news&#34;&gt;I have great news!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the grace of God, I have been able to raise all of the necessary funds to spend the entire summer in the Czech Republic! Thank you to everyone who chose to contribute financially! I want to continue to invite you into deeper relationship via mutual prayer and encouragement. Praise be to God! He is so faithful. This season has been a season full of His provision. Here are some things you can be praying for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pray for the missionaries who are promoting the camps right now in the Czech Republic!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pray for the churches who are putting together the camps. There are a lot of logistical details that need to be worked out. Pray that the Lord will bring ease and peace to those people making those decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pray that the other interns on my team can be supported! If you were planning on giving to me but have not yet done so, I encourage you to support the other two interns who will be serving with me throughout the summer, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.josiahventure.com/give-form/?designation=49767846-1ca9-4e5a-a0db-8b6742d781fe&amp;amp;user=54334&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Petr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.josiahventure.org.uk/uk-giving?id=54081&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lydia&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pray for intern directors who are organizing provisions for my team and myself, that they would be able to do this with ease!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, pray for the war in Ukraine 🇺🇦. We as Christians would do well to petition the Lord for peace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am so excited to see how the Lord is going to work this summer. I am also grateful that He has invited all of us into participating in His kingdom work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;having-bold-faith&#34;&gt;Having &lt;strong&gt;BOLD&lt;/strong&gt; Faith&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over my spring break (a month ago), I was feeling the weight of my future. I was wrestling with the uncertainty that lay ahead of me. My good friend would say that I was aware God is on His throne, but I was not trusting in that His plan is what is best for me and for His glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in Arizona a little over a month ago, I went for a walk. I was praying and was prompted to read Mark 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrative begins in verse 14. Jesus was just coming down the mountain after the transfiguration, when he was bombarded by a crowd of people. They were originally surrounding the disciples who had not ascended the mountain with Jesus. A demon-possessed boy was brought before Jesus, who was told his disciples could not cast the demon out of the boy. Verses 20-24 read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They brought the boy to Him. When he saw Him, immediately the spirit threw him into a convulsion, and falling to the ground, he began rolling around and foaming at the mouth. And He asked his father, &amp;ldquo;How long has this been happening to him?&amp;rdquo; And he said, &amp;ldquo;From childhood. It has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, take pity on us and help us!&amp;rsquo; And Jesus said to him, ‘If You can? All things are possible to him who believes.&amp;rsquo; Immediately the boy’s father cried out and said, `I do believe; help my unbelief.&#39;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading this, I wept. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but notice how the boy&amp;rsquo;s father had said &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;If You can do anything&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; I was faced with the reality that too often, when I ask the Lord for things, I possess a posture of doubt. &amp;ldquo;God, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you can&amp;hellip;[insert petition].&amp;rdquo; The problem with this is if I truly believe sanctification looks like my desires growing more consistent with the Lord&amp;rsquo;s desires, then I should have no problem believing that God can and will grant my petitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to be mindful to walk the line between being comfortable and full of faith in my prayers, yet acknowledging that God is so much more than a granter of requests. Our end game is to be united with Him in His death and resurrection, and to embody Him to others so that they might come to know Him. Part of this looks like our desires becoming His. If this is the case, I can boldly approach His throne with full confidence, acknowledging that He is faithful! (Hebrews 4:16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thanks-be-to-god&#34;&gt;Thanks be to God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks be to God for this opportunity to be a part of this summer ministry. The Lord is more than capable of anything we can ask or imagine. I want to thank everyone who has chosen to support me via financial provisions or prayer, and I would love to invite you into more prayer. Stay tuned for more prayer updates, and in the meantime, let me know how I can pray for you in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://carsonslater.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;contact form&lt;/a&gt; on the homepage!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is a Biblical Theology of Mission?</title>
      <link>https://carsonslater.com/post/bibtheomissions/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-write-this&#34;&gt;Why Write This?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greetings! As I am spending my summer doing missions in Europe, and I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into how missions fits into God&amp;rsquo;s overarching plan to redeem humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to point out that although this article has everything to do with what I am doing this summer, it simultaneously has nothing to do with the specific particularities of my summer. My reflections on mission are simply an exercise of preparation as I gear up for the coming season. Hence, this post most definitely will feel a little more dry if you are expecting something personal. I hope you find that reflecting on God&amp;rsquo;s holistic plan introduces a new, vibrant lens that showcases the significance of our day to day ministry tasks we engage in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-point&#34;&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing theology for the sake of the intellectual stimulation, or knowledge acquisition, can be profitable and well intented; however, the reason I write this article is to invite people to &lt;em&gt;know God&lt;/em&gt;. Knowing God is infinitely more valuable than having wrestled with all theological topics and concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theology is an  opportunity to better understand and seek God for the sake of intimacy. My prayer for this article is that if you read this, you may be introduced to a new or better understanding of the epic plan for God&amp;rsquo;s people, and maybe catch a new glimpse of the Planner Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-biblical-theology&#34;&gt;What is Biblical Theology?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the first time I had heard the phrase, &amp;lsquo;Biblical Theology&amp;rsquo; in a Christian circle. Naively, my knee jerk reaction was: &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t all Theology Biblical?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It turns out that I was wrong, at least in one sense. What I ended up learning is that there are different ways of doing theology. There are different approaches that can be taken to learning about God. To quote Andrew David Naselli,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Biblical theology is a way of analyzing and synthesizing the Bible that makes organic, salvation-historical connections with the whole canon on its own terms, especially how the Old and New Testaments progress, integrate, and climax in Christ.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a shortcut, the framework I like to use to think about biblical theology is by comparing it to other ways of doing theology. At its core, biblical theology, systematic theology, and historical theology are all avenues of studying God, but they are distinct in their own right. Historical theology is beautiful because it heavily considers and analyzes church history and theological development. Systematic theology presupposes questions and goes to Scriputre for answers, for the sake of building a robust framework to think about God. Biblical Theology, on the other hand, is exegesis in light of the whole Scripture. Biblical Theology uses the historical narrative of the Bible, and allows Scripture to raise questions about God on its own terms. It consults the development of the redemptive narrative for answers, and engages typologies to trace big thematic elements in the Bible. This is why Biblical Theology is of particular interest to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-biblical-theology-of-mission&#34;&gt;A Biblical Theology of Mission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-few-disclaimers&#34;&gt;A Few Disclaimers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to put my cards on the table by acknowledging that I am by no means a theological scholar, rather I am just a humble college student. I may grow excited in my writing about specific salvation-historical connections, but at the end of the day, there are some sobering facts to acknowledge about the mission of the people of God:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is sovereign. (Ps. 115:3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humanity cannot save themselves. (Eph. 2:1-3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God invites humanity into reconciliation, not only restoring humanity to a relationship with Himself, but inviting us to become co-laborers with Him. (2 Cor. 5:17-19)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The entirety of the people of God will be able to worship God in unity with Christ, resulting in passionate praise for all eternity. (Rev. 5:9-10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God invites His people to participate in this outpouring of salvation by enabling them to become lights in a dark world; the people of God are not the source of the light, but the conduit. (2 Cor. 4:5-7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more disclaimer is that the discipline of Biblical Theology is like a game of pick-up-sticks. It is hard to trace one particular theme without disturbing or untangling it from other themes in Scripture, as they are heavily interwoven. Hence, in this article I may gloss over really important facts that are relevant but mostly relate to other themes in Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-original-comission&#34;&gt;The Original Comission&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God created the earth, He created His image within a garden sanctuary. It was the place where the people had &lt;em&gt;intimate communion with God&lt;/em&gt;. Afterwards, humanity reject this calling by imitating the serpent. Ultimately, God still wanted to magnify Himself in the universe, with the people that He had originally created. After cursing the earth, God still promised to deliver His people from their rebellion, restoring them to be right-working image-bearers of Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-blessing-for-all-nations&#34;&gt;A Blessing for All Nations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get a glimpse for God&amp;rsquo;s plan to reconcile all peoples to Himself when He commissions Abram to go forth to possess a specific portion of Canaan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Now the Lord said to Abram, “Go forth from your country, And from your relatives And from your father’s house, To the land which I will show you; And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless you, And make your name great; And so you shall be a blessing; And I will bless those who bless you, And the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.&amp;quot;&amp;rsquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people are quick to point out how in Abram &amp;ldquo;all the families of the earth will be blessed.&amp;rdquo; What tends to be overlooked is that God states that Abram is to be a blessing &lt;strong&gt;in the land to which He is going&lt;/strong&gt;. Dr. Jason S. DeRouchie notes that God&amp;rsquo;s covenant with Abram required that He go to Canaan, so that He may become a great nation (Israel), but that eventually one day Abram (or perhaps His representative) would be a blessing to all nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;come-and-see&#34;&gt;Come and See&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram then became Abraham, and His offspring endured 400+ years of slavery in Egypt. Following the Exodus, God used this offspring (again, the nation Israel) to mediate God&amp;rsquo;s presence and blessings to the surrounding nations. Through radical submission, Abraham&amp;rsquo;s offspring would serve as holy representatives to a needy world. Israel as a nation was not evangelistic; their mission was to cultivate a covenant community that was not exclusive to foreigners. Hence, Israel&amp;rsquo;s culture, customs and laws served as an invitation to the world to &amp;lsquo;come and see&amp;rsquo; what God was doing. This was Israel&amp;rsquo;s &amp;rsquo;limited&amp;rsquo; mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;visions-of-hope-and-reconciliation&#34;&gt;Visions of Hope and Reconciliation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people of God now are living in covenant community in the land, and prophecies begin to emerge and reminding Israel that God&amp;rsquo;s promises were to bring good news for all nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the Lord all the offspring of Israel will be justified and will glory.” &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blessing is depicted in Isaiah by the servant songs. These songs depict a &amp;lsquo;servant&amp;rsquo; that ministers to both Israel and the nations. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This royal servant would&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enjoy God&amp;rsquo;s presence and would fulfill his mission to bring justice to the nations, (&lt;a href=&#34;https://my.bible.com/bible/100/ISA.42.1-4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Isa. 42:1-4&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;engage in a ministry of mercy, (&lt;a href=&#34;https://my.bible.com/bible/100/ISA.51.4-5&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Isa. 51:4-5&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;guide the lost, (&lt;a href=&#34;https://my.bible.com/bible/100/ISA.61.1-3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Isa. 61:1-3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;serve as a covenant mediator,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open the eyes of the blind and deliver the captive, (&lt;a href=&#34;https://my.bible.com/bible/100/ISA.42.6-7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Isa.42:6-7&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and preach the good news of God&amp;rsquo;s victory over evil and God&amp;rsquo;s saving grace. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://my.bible.com/bible/100/ISA.52.7-10&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Isa. 52:7-10&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;https://my.bible.com/bible/100/ISA.61.1-3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt; 61:1-3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only in Isaiah do we see God&amp;rsquo;s heart for the nations, but also in Jonah. Many like to pigeonhole Jonah as the missionary archetype, but I would particularly argue that He was appointed for a specific mission rather than as a New Covenant missionary. Jonah serves as an example of &lt;em&gt;Israel&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; outreach to the nations, but is helpful to acknowledge in a Biblical Theology of mission because he serves as a reminder that God is always interested in the whole world. This is all despite His choosing of Israel to mediate for Him initially within the salvation-historical narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-new-covenant-in-christ&#34;&gt;The New Covenant in Christ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we find is that Jesus arrives as the incarnate God, and He fulfills these prophecies of the servant in Isaiah. Not only does He accomplish this, but He fulfills the Law, conquers death, and institutes the New Covenant.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In this New Covenant, the people of God take on posture of faith, which leads to obedience and extends worship beyond the walls of the temple. The people of God are no longer exclusively Jews, but also Gentiles, making salvation available for all peoples of all nations.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;go-and-tell&#34;&gt;Go and Tell&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Jesus&amp;rsquo;s last statements before the ascension was the Great Commission. Before sending His disciples - the people of God - out into the world to teach all that He had taught, He reminds His disciples that &amp;ldquo;all authority on heaven and earth has been given to&amp;rdquo; Himself.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Christians on mission do well to observe the omnipotence and authority of their Master, their Savior Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This commission amends to the overall disposition of the people of God as a &amp;lsquo;come and see&amp;rsquo; covenant community to also a &amp;lsquo;go and tell&amp;rsquo; mindset. In the Old Testament, God&amp;rsquo;s people are a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. Now the church, filled and empowered by the Holy Spirit, also acts as God&amp;rsquo;s dynamic living temple-sanctuary who aims to shine lights in a dark world. The church was created to show the rest of the world who their beautiful Creator and Sustainer is. The church truly is the fulfillment of Acts 1:8, where Jesus before His ascension states that His disciples will receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and go to the ends of the earth to bear witness and testimony about the Lord. &lt;em&gt;The church was made for mission.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-his-kingdom-comes&#34;&gt;When His Kingdom Comes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salvation truly does belong to the Lamb who sits on the throne.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One of the most beautiful passages of Scripture is in Revelation 5:9. Here John the apostle describes a vision where people from every nation, tribe, and tongue are worshiping God. As John Piper once wrote, &amp;lsquo;Missions exists because worship doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rsquo; One reason the kingdom of God possesses beauty is because it is multi-ethnic! God has invited His people, the church, into this mission of self-revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As God&amp;rsquo;s image bearers rejected their duties to bear God&amp;rsquo;s image, God enacted a plan to magnify Himself in the universe. Seeking reconciliation with all peoples, God promised that the seed of the woman would crush the head of the serpent, whom the people imitated. He promised to bless all the nations of the earth through the line of Abram, and build up a covenant nation called to be set apart for God&amp;rsquo;s purposes. This community was to be a nation of holy priests so that all other nations might &amp;lsquo;come and see&amp;rsquo; what God was doing in Israel. After continual promises of restoration, God sent the Messiah as He promised. This suffering servant instituted the New Covenant, adding a &amp;lsquo;go and tell&amp;rsquo; posture to the people of God, outpouring His power onto them through the Holy Spirit, all so that the world may worship Him one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;application&#34;&gt;Application&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking holistically about mission through a biblical theological framework must not be mistaken for a thought experiment! Biblical Theology is a tool that can prevent Christians from missing the forest for the trees. Not only does this help us observe God&amp;rsquo;s overarching plan for His people, but it uncovers His heart for humanity. Additionally, seeing the entirety of God&amp;rsquo;s plan for His people serves as a humbling reminder for how small, yet crucial of a role each individual plays in the plan. In the midst of the knitty-gritty details of our respective ministries, such as serving at an English Camp in Europe, we can be reminded that nothing can stand in the way of God as He accomplishes His plans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Heartbeat Behind Support Raising</title>
      <link>https://carsonslater.com/post/support/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Mar 2023 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://carsonslater.com/post/support/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I prepare for the upcoming summer, I have been tasked with raising $5400 of support by May 1; that gives me just over a month to raise the funds from the time of posting this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-temptation&#34;&gt;The Temptation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I confess that as someone who is supposed to be paying attention to the quantity of funding coming in, it is very easy to uphold a reductionist attitude toward support raising. It can easily be boiled down to be a means to an end. This is such a counter-intuitive way to think about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I neglect the people on the other side of my invitation for support, I miss out on so many things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Whoever brings blessing will be enriched, and one who waters will himself be watered.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;partnership&#34;&gt;Partnership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at one of the first-ever New Covenant short-term missionaries in Scripture. His name was Epaphroditus, and a short blurb was written about him in Philippians 2:25-30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Paul, Epaphroditus was sent to him in Rome by the church of Philippi, and he was able to deliver necessary supplies to Paul to assist with his ministry. Although it does not specify how, Epaphroditus nearly dies of illness while on this journey. I want to highlight what Paul says about him though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epaphroditus was used as the tangible component of the church of Philippi&amp;rsquo;s partnership with Paul. Recall that in chapter 1 of Philippians,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Paul writes about his partnership with the church of Philippi. Here are some of the things he writes about them as his supporters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every time he thinks of them, he thanks God. (v. 3-4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He considers them partners in the gospel. (v. 5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He reminds the church of the perfect work of Jesus in them being brought to completion via sanctification. (v. 6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He considers them partakers of grace. (v. 7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope and prayer is that if you choose to partner with me in prayer or with financial support, please let me know and reach out! I would love to pray for you as you partake in the grace that God has bestowed upon you and others in your proximity. We can partner together to make known the riches of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s kindness. I certainly have been forgiven much, so it only makes sense that I love others much by sharing a salvific message with them, to the glory of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing the supporter-supportee relationship to a transaction yields minimal fruit, if any. There are so many blessings that come from that rich fellowship, and the Paul-Philippi example is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-invitation-to-co-labor&#34;&gt;An Invitation to Co-Labor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heartbeat behind support raising is to invite people into ministry through prayer and financial support. I hope to engage in mutual encouragement and prayer to labor and yearn for the kingdom of God on this earth &lt;strong&gt;together&lt;/strong&gt;, and the for redemption of the lost. I pray that reports of my efforts would elicit or inspire a Spirit-driven desire within you to engage in gospel work where you are at. Thank you to everyone who has set such a phenomenal example for me in my upbringing of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bold-faith&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOLD&lt;/strong&gt; Faith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that if God is bigger than all I can ask or imagine, and that if He calls me His son, He would have no problem with me asking for great things in &lt;strong&gt;bold faith&lt;/strong&gt;. God is investing in His children to yield a return of 30, 60, or 100 fold! Investors want their investments to yield 100-fold returns! That is exactly why I am inviting everyone I can into this partnership, asking for as much as they are able to give cheerfully. I am so excited to see what God does this summer when He chooses to move in the regions of central and eastern Europe. I truly hold onto this exhortation in 2 Corinthians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;&amp;ldquo;And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nice-theory-but-what-about-practice&#34;&gt;Nice Theory, but What About Practice?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will I invite you into this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already received one, I&amp;rsquo;d love to send you a support letter! It gives details of my trip, what I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing, and what to pray for as I prepare for my summer missionary internship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if you feel led, I invite you to give! You can click &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.josiahventure.com/give-form/?designation=689836c4-8b96-407c-afb1-27c679d96029&amp;amp;user=53992&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to find the online donation portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be remissed if our contact stopped at those two pathways. I encourage you to go to the home page and fill out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://carsonslater.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;contact form&lt;/a&gt; with a message desribing how I can stay in contact with you. I can also add you to the subscriber list for when I post for this blog! This blog will be updated weekly while I am in Europe, so stay tuned for prayer requests!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, my phone number is on the contact page as well. I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you with any prayer requests you have that I can be praying for. This will help me be aware of what God is doing in your life, and how I can encourage you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cell phone number is +1 (480) 320-8898. Text me anytime!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-am-fighting-for-this-posture&#34;&gt;How I am Fighting for This Posture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josiah Venture actually had me take a small reflective course on support raising. Support raising can be uncomfortable because you don&amp;rsquo;t see the other side of what you believe God is calling you into, until you get there. In other words, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I will have all of my funds raised by May 1, but I know that God can provide. This is an opportunity to trust in His provision, even though I cannot see the outcome. This is inherently uncomfortable, but that is okay! In my support raising course, I was asked to chart out a few lies I was fighting to reject. I was then asked to rebuke those same lies with the truth. Here are some of the things I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lie 1&lt;/strong&gt;: I can control the things that truly aren&amp;rsquo;t within my control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truth 1&lt;/strong&gt;: At the end of the day, I do not control how many people decide to support me, but I can be faithful by inviting them into this process and journey with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lie 2&lt;/strong&gt;: I can passively wait for God to provide support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truth 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Faithfulness is an active posture. I still need to invite support from others, and trust God will take care of the rest. Money or prayer from others does not &amp;lsquo;fall out of the sky&amp;rsquo; in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lie 3&lt;/strong&gt;: My prayers do not do anything in the support raising process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truth 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Prayer is not preparation for the work. Prayer IS the work. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; God invites us to petition for His provision as an act of faith and worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-expression-of-gratitude&#34;&gt;An Expression of Gratitude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ι hope this post is able to unpack the nuance surrounding my support raising journey for you. I pray that as you consider joining what God is doing in Central and Eastern Europe, that God will begin to unveil things in your own heart, that you yourself may grow in intimacy with Him. He is the true fount of our salvation; He is our portion! Thanks be to God, for enabling us to co-labor with Him as broken yet mighty vessels of grace, by the power of His Holy Spirit. Thank you for taking the time to read this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Returning to Europe</title>
      <link>https://carsonslater.com/post/returning/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Feb 2023 00:00:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://carsonslater.com/post/returning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear reader,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that if you take the time to read this post, you may be encouraged to draw near to Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and to whom are all things. My prayer is that you grow in the assurance of your calling to reconciliation with God and His mission on this earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-prior-experiences&#34;&gt;My Prior Experiences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I had the amazing opportunity to join a team from my church in Arizona on a trip to the Czech Republic where we partnered with a local Czech church to facilitate an English Camp. At this camp, we shared the gospel with youth in their area through various talks and small group discussions in the evenings. I embarked on the trip with an awareness of Europe’s larger attitude toward Protestant Christianity, having previously served in Romania three times, but I came back to the States with a yearning to return, in order that I may continue to walk in the good works the Lord has prepared for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am excited to write to you now to inform you that God has provided an opportunity for me to return to the Czech Republic, only for a longer period of time. After going to Europe to engage people with the gospel four times, I cannot deny the strategy I see behind living in Europe as a Christian, let alone serving alongside missionaries who are already actively working there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-why&#34;&gt;My &amp;lsquo;Why&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently attend college in a city that is ranked on this list for the most churches per capita in the world. I grew up less than a mile away from two large churches, and even a Presbyterian church to sweeten the deal. My experiences in Europe have shown me that a European mega-church usually consists of around 100 members, as opposed to the 2,000+ members that I am prone to visualize when I picture a stereotypical American mega-church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention this to illustrate that in America, people actually have options of where they choose to go to church, which is not a reality everywhere in Europe. This disparity points to the notion that there is much work to be done in exposing people to the gospel in Europe. There are so many people in Europe living a life that has never been exposed to Jesus in a personal way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The population of the Czech Republic is approximately 0.737% evangelical &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s right. Less than a percent. However, this percent has a growth rate of 0.3% per year! There are believers on the ground in this nation, and I am honored to be given the opportunity to walk alongside them for two and a half months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-posture&#34;&gt;My Posture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I was able to serve at English Camp with a Church in Český Těšín, CZ. I was coming out of a very heavy season of life, where I had just quit baseball (I had played for 13 years and gotten to the college level) and was convicted that I had used it as an means to glorify myself. I had been drawn to missions in high school before, but after coming to Wheaton, I was less mindful of it while pursuing other passions that I have since deemed as not conducive to spiritual growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was in this heavy season, one of my pastors at my church in Wheaton shared a verse with me before I left for Europe last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
(Ephesians 2:10 NASB)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I was encouraged when I heard it, I had no clue how clear this would become while I was serving. I was able to reframe missions as my participation in building the most honorable kingdom - the kingdom of God. Missions was not the passion of my past, rather it was restored as a means by which I could walk in the good works God has prepared for me. I want to accept this invitation from the Lord to partake in His masterful building plan for His kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By no means am I saying that missions is the ONLY way to walk in the good works God has prepared for me. That would be to suppose the sacred-secular divide is real, which is not true. I just know that the Holy Spirit empowered me to get excited about sharing my first love with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, I am going back. I am by no means sufficient to carry this out on my own, but I know God&amp;rsquo;s power is perfected in my weakness. I just need to act in faith and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-even-is-this&#34;&gt;What even is this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a place where I plan on sharing my thoughts, experienes, and things I have found to be encouragements in my life!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why&lt;/strong&gt;: This blog is inspired by my desire to encourage people to follow Jesus. More specifically, I was inspired by a practice my church group did when we were serving in the Czech Republic through an organization called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.josiahventure.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Josiah Venture&lt;/a&gt;, where we &lt;a href=&#34;https://fbcaz.com/all-good/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; about our experiences to bring our local church body alongside us our Journey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Whom&lt;/strong&gt;: The intended audience for this blog is anyone who is partnering with me in my endeavors to share the gospel with youth. While my intended audience is limited, this blog is actually for anyone and everyone! Please join in praying for me as I prepare to spend my summer as an intern with Josiah Venture!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-you-plan-on-posting-here&#34;&gt;What do you plan on posting here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to share with you my experiences preparing for my JV summer internship, as well as my experiences during the internship. After my time in Czechía, I will be able to reflect on the things that God was showing me along the way!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I also have ambitions to publish some of my own writing here - mainly about books I want to review, ideas I want to share, and things I would love to invite you to consider!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-josiahventurehttpswwwjosiahventurecom&#34;&gt;What is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.josiahventure.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;JosiahVenture&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josiah Venture is a mission organization focused on raising up youth leaders in Central and Eastern Europe. Their mission statement can be found on their website, but I&amp;rsquo;ve retrieved it here for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div align=&#34;left&#34;&gt;&#34;This is the vision of Josiah Venture, a vision for a movement of God among the youth of Central and Eastern Europe that finds its home in the local church and transforms society. Our mission and calling is to equip young leaders to fulfill Christ’s commission by reaching and making disciples. More than just conversion, we want to see passionate followers of Jesus Christ, with a vision to reach and disciple their generation for him.&#34;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heartbeat behind Josiah Venture is actually derived from the story of King Josiah of Israel (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2CH.34.ESV&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;read here&lt;/a&gt;). He inherits the throne of Israel at age eight. He did what was right in the eyes of God, purged the nation of places reserved for idol worship, and sought to reorient the people to follow God once again. As an organization, Josiah Venture seeks to find and raise up more Josiah&amp;rsquo;s across Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-will-you-be-serving&#34;&gt;How will you be serving?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be serving alongside the current Josiah Venture missionaries that are already in Czechía by partnering with local churches to promote, plan, and facilitate English Camps across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;can-you-give-me-a-preview-of-what-this-will-look-like-somehow&#34;&gt;Can you give me a preview of what this will look like somehow?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t exactly look into the future, but I imagine it will look similar to the camp I served last summer, when my church in AZ partnered with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbtesin.cz/en/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;local Czech church&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/h3TBU2FuNTE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I anticipated the questions you might have. If not, feel free to contact me with more questions via the form on the home page. I was led to create this blog in December 2022, and it is super fun to finally see it come to fruition. Glory be to God, and may this page be one that is edifying to all who read it!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My hope and prayer is that if you have chosen to let Jesus rule over your life, that you may be spurred on to love and good works (Hebrews 10:24), and that if you do not yet have Jesus as the ruler of your life, that you’d stick around for the sake of curiosity. After all, I’ll probably be posting more than just summer preparatory items on here! &lt;br&gt;
