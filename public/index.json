By the grace of God, I have been able to raise all of the necessary funds to spend the entire summer in the Czech Republic! Thank you to everyone who chose to contribute financially! I want to continue to invite you into deeper relationship via mutual prayer and encouragement. Praise be to God! He is so faithful. This season has been a season full of His provision. Here are some things you can be praying for:\nPray for the missionaries who are promoting the camps right now in the Czech Republic! Pray for the churches who are putting together the camps. There are a lot of logistical details that need to be worked out. Pray that the Lord will bring ease and peace to those people making those decisions. Pray that the other interns on my team can be supported! If you were planning on giving to me but have not yet done so, I encourage you to support the other two interns who will be serving with me throughout the summer, Petr and Lydia! Pray for intern directors who are organizing provisions for my team and myself, that they would be able to do this with ease! Lastly, pray for the war in Ukraine üá∫üá¶. We as Christians would do well to petition the Lord for peace. I am so excited to see how the Lord is going to work this summer. I am also grateful that He has invited all of us into participating in His kingdom work.\nHaving BOLD Faith Over my spring break (a month ago), I was feeling the weight of my future. I was wrestling with the uncertainty that lay ahead of me. My good friend would say that I was aware God is on His throne, but I was not trusting in that His plan is what is best for me and for His glory.\nWhile in Arizona a little over a month ago, I went for a walk. I was praying and was prompted to read Mark 9.\nThe narrative begins in verse 14. Jesus was just coming down the mountain after the transfiguration, when he was bombarded by a crowd of people. They were originally surrounding the disciples who had not ascended the mountain with Jesus. A demon-possessed boy was brought before Jesus, who was told his disciples could not cast the demon out of the boy. Verses 20-24 read:\n‚ÄúThey brought the boy to Him. When he saw Him, immediately the spirit threw him into a convulsion, and falling to the ground, he began rolling around and foaming at the mouth. And He asked his father, ‚ÄúHow long has this been happening to him?‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúFrom childhood. It has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, take pity on us and help us!‚Äô And Jesus said to him, ‚ÄòIf You can? All things are possible to him who believes.‚Äô Immediately the boy‚Äôs father cried out and said, `I do believe; help my unbelief.\u0026#39;‚Äù\nAfter reading this, I wept. I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how the boy‚Äôs father had said ‚ÄúIf You can do anything‚Ä¶‚Äù I was faced with the reality that too often, when I ask the Lord for things, I possess a posture of doubt. ‚ÄúGod, if you can‚Ä¶[insert petition].‚Äù The problem with this is if I truly believe sanctification looks like my desires growing more consistent with the Lord‚Äôs desires, then I should have no problem believing that God can and will grant my petitions.\nI need to be mindful to walk the line between being comfortable and full of faith in my prayers, yet acknowledging that God is so much more than a granter of requests. Our end game is to be united with Him in His death and resurrection, and to embody Him to others so that they might come to know Him. Part of this looks like our desires becoming His. If this is the case, I can boldly approach His throne with full confidence, acknowledging that He is faithful! (Hebrews 4:16)\nThanks be to God Thanks be to God for this opportunity to be a part of this summer ministry. The Lord is more than capable of anything we can ask or imagine. I want to thank everyone who has chosen to support me via financial provisions or prayer, and I would love to invite you into more prayer. Stay tuned for more prayer updates, and in the meantime, let me know how I can pray for you in the contact form on the homepage!\nœáŒ¨œÅŒπœÑŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±·º∞ Œµ·º∞œÅŒÆŒΩŒ∑,\n(grace and peace)\n- Carson\n","date":1681862405,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681862405,"objectID":"a17ddd7f2c1c02bc91f381c0c975a31c","permalink":"https://carsonslater.com/post/funded/","publishdate":"2023-04-19T00:00:05Z","relpermalink":"/post/funded/","section":"post","summary":"'Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever.

As I am spending my summer doing missions in Europe, and I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into how missions fits into God‚Äôs overarching plan to redeem humanity.\nI would love to point out that although this article has everything to do with what I am doing this summer, it simultaneously has nothing to do with the specific particularities of my summer. My reflections on mission are simply an exercise of preparation as I gear up for the coming season. Hence, this post most definitely will feel a little more dry if you are expecting something personal. I hope you find that reflecting on God‚Äôs holistic plan introduces a new, vibrant lens that showcases the significance of our day to day ministry tasks we engage in.\nThe Point Doing theology for the sake of the intellectual stimulation, or knowledge acquisition, can be profitable and well intented; however, the reason I write this article is to invite people to know God. Knowing God is infinitely more valuable than having wrestled with all theological topics and concepts.\nTheology is an opportunity to better understand and seek God for the sake of intimacy. My prayer for this article is that if you read this, you may be introduced to a new or better understanding of the epic plan for God‚Äôs people, and maybe catch a new glimpse of the Planner Himself.\nWhat is Biblical Theology? I remember the first time I had heard the phrase, ‚ÄòBiblical Theology‚Äô in a Christian circle. Naively, my knee jerk reaction was: ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt all Theology Biblical?‚Äù\nIt turns out that I was wrong, at least in one sense. What I ended up learning is that there are different ways of doing theology. There are different approaches that can be taken to learning about God. To quote Andrew David Naselli,\n‚ÄúBiblical theology is a way of analyzing and synthesizing the Bible that makes organic, salvation-historical connections with the whole canon on its own terms, especially how the Old and New Testaments progress, integrate, and climax in Christ.‚Äù1\nAs a shortcut, the framework I like to use to think about biblical theology is by comparing it to other ways of doing theology. At its core, biblical theology, systematic theology, and historical theology are all avenues of studying God, but they are distinct in their own right. Historical theology is beautiful because it heavily considers and analyzes church history and theological development. Systematic theology presupposes questions and goes to Scriputre for answers, for the sake of building a robust framework to think about God. Biblical Theology, on the other hand, is exegesis in light of the whole Scripture. Biblical Theology uses the historical narrative of the Bible, and allows Scripture to raise questions about God on its own terms. It consults the development of the redemptive narrative for answers, and engages typologies to trace big thematic elements in the Bible. This is why Biblical Theology is of particular interest to me.\nA Biblical Theology of Mission A Few Disclaimers I want to put my cards on the table by acknowledging that I am by no means a theological scholar, rather I am just a humble college student. I may grow excited in my writing about specific salvation-historical connections, but at the end of the day, there are some sobering facts to acknowledge about the mission of the people of God:\nGod is sovereign. (Ps. 115:3) Humanity cannot save themselves. (Eph. 2:1-3) God invites humanity into reconciliation, not only restoring humanity to a relationship with Himself, but inviting us to become co-laborers with Him. (2 Cor. 5:17-19) The entirety of the people of God will be able to worship God in unity with Christ, resulting in passionate praise for all eternity. (Rev. 5:9-10) God invites His people to participate in this outpouring of salvation by enabling them to become lights in a dark world; the people of God are not the source of the light, but the conduit. (2 Cor. 4:5-7) One more disclaimer is that the discipline of Biblical Theology is like a game of pick-up-sticks. It is hard to trace one particular theme without disturbing or untangling it from other themes in Scripture, as they are heavily interwoven. Hence, in this article I may gloss over really important facts that are relevant but mostly relate to over themes in Scripture.\nThe Original Comission When God created the earth, He created His image within a garden sanctuary. It was the place where the people had intimate communion with God. Afterwards, humanity reject this calling by imitating the serpent. Ultimately, God still wanted to magnify Himself in the universe, with the people that He had originally created. After cursing the earth, God still promised to deliver His people from their rebellion, restoring them to be right-working image-bearers of Himself.\nA Blessing for All Nations We get a glimpse for God‚Äôs plan to reconcile all peoples to Himself when He commissions Abram to go forth to possess a specific portion of Canaan.\n‚ÄòNow the Lord said ‚Ä¶","date":1680480005,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680480005,"objectID":"128b7d1038247412cb140c3754e8bdb3","permalink":"https://carsonslater.com/post/bibtheomissions/","publishdate":"2023-04-03T00:00:05Z","relpermalink":"/post/bibtheomissions/","section":"post","summary":"Mission was not made for the church. The church was made for mission.","tags":["Missions","Blog"],"title":"What is a Biblical Theology of Mission?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Carson Slater"],"categories":["Blog"],"content":"As I prepare for the upcoming summer, I have been tasked with raising $5400 of support by May 1; that gives me just over a month to raise the funds from the time of posting this.\nThe Temptation I confess that as someone who is supposed to be paying attention to the quantity of funding coming in, it is very easy to uphold a reductionist attitude toward support raising. It can easily be boiled down to be a means to an end. This is such a counter-intuitive way to think about it!\nWhen I neglect the people on the other side of my invitation for support, I miss out on so many things.\n‚ÄúWhoever brings blessing will be enriched, and one who waters will himself be watered.1‚Äù\nPartnership Let‚Äôs take a look at one of the first-ever New Covenant short-term missionaries in Scripture. His name was Epaphroditus, and a short blurb was written about him in Philippians 2:25-30.\nAccording to Paul, Epaphroditus was sent to him in Rome by the church of Philippi, and he was able to deliver necessary supplies to Paul to assist with his ministry. Although it does not specify how, Epaphroditus nearly dies of illness while on this journey. I want to highlight what Paul says about him though:\n‚ÄúI have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need.‚Äù2\nEpaphroditus was used as the tangible component of the church of Philippi‚Äôs partnership with Paul. Recall that in chapter 1 of Philippians,3 Paul writes about his partnership with the church of Philippi. Here are some of the things he writes about them as his supporters:\nEvery time he thinks of them, he thanks God. (v. 3-4) He considers them partners in the gospel. (v. 5) He reminds the church of the perfect work of Jesus in them being brought to completion via sanctification. (v. 6) He considers them partakers of grace. (v. 7) My hope and prayer is that if you choose to partner with me in prayer or with financial support, please let me know and reach out! I would love to pray for you as you partake in the grace that God has bestowed upon you and others in your proximity. We can partner together to make known the riches of the Lord‚Äôs kindness. I certainly have been forgiven much, so it only makes sense that I love others much by sharing a salvific message with them, to the glory of God.\nReducing the supporter-supportee relationship to a transaction yields minimal fruit, if any. There are so many blessings that come from that rich fellowship, and the Paul-Philippi example is no exception.\nAn Invitation to Co-Labor My heartbeat behind support raising is to invite people into ministry through prayer and financial support. I hope to engage in mutual encouragement and prayer to labor and yearn for the kingdom of God on this earth together, and the for redemption of the lost. I pray that reports of my efforts would elicit or inspire a Spirit-driven desire within you to engage in gospel work where you are at. Thank you to everyone who has set such a phenomenal example for me in my upbringing of this.\nBOLD Faith I believe that if God is bigger than all I can ask or imagine, and that if He calls me His son, He would have no problem with me asking for great things in bold faith. God is investing in His children to yield a return of 30, 60, or 100 fold! Investors want their investments to yield 100-fold returns! That is exactly why I am inviting everyone I can into this partnership, asking for as much as they are able to give cheerfully. I am so excited to see what God does this summer when He chooses to move in the regions of central and eastern Europe. I truly hold onto this exhoration in 2 Corinthians:\n‚Äò‚ÄúAnd God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work.‚Äù4\nNice Theory, but What About Practice? How will I invite you into this?\nIf you haven‚Äôt already received one, I‚Äôd love to send you a support letter!

My prayer is that you grow in the assurance of your calling to reconciliation with God and His mission on this earth.\nMy Prior Experiences Last summer, I had the amazing opportunity to join a team from my church in Arizona on a trip to the Czech Republic where we partnered with a local Czech church to facilitate an English Camp. At this camp, we shared the gospel with youth in their area through various talks and small group discussions in the evenings. I embarked on the trip with an awareness of Europe‚Äôs larger attitude toward Protestant Christianity, having previously served in Romania three times, but I came back to the States with a yearning to return, in order that I may continue to walk in the good works the Lord has prepared for me.\nI am excited to write to you now to inform you that God has provided an opportunity for me to return to the Czech Republic, only for a longer period of time. After going to Europe to engage people with the gospel four times, I cannot deny the strategy I see behind living in Europe as a Christian, let alone serving alongside missionaries who are already actively working there.\nMy ‚ÄòWhy‚Äô I currently attend college in a city that is ranked on this list for the most churches per capita in the world. I grew up less than a mile away from two large churches, and even a Presbyterian church to sweeten the deal. My experiences in Europe have shown me that a European mega-church usually consists of around 100 members, as opposed to the 2,000+ members that I am prone to visualize when I picture a stereotypical American mega-church.\nI mention this to illustrate that in America, people actually have options of where they choose to go to church, which is not a reality everywhere in Europe. This disparity points to the notion that there is much work to be done in exposing people to the gospel in Europe. There are so many people in Europe living a life that has never been exposed to Jesus in a personal way.\nThe population of the Czech Republic is approximately 0.737% evangelical 1. That‚Äôs right. Less than a percent. However, this percent has a growth rate of 0.3% per year! There are believers on the ground in this nation, and I am honored to be given the opportunity to walk alongside them for two and a half months.\nMy Posture Last summer, I was able to serve at English Camp with a Church in ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n, CZ. I was coming out of a very heavy season of life, where I had just quit baseball (I had played for 13 years and gotten to the college level) and was convicted that I had used it as an means to glorify myself. I had been drawn to missions in high school before, but after coming to Wheaton, I was less mindful of it while pursuing other passions that I have since deemed as not conducive to spiritual growth.\nAs I was in this heavy season, one of my pastors at my church in Wheaton shared a verse with me before I left for Europe last summer.\n‚ÄúFor we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.‚Äù\n(Ephesians 2:10 NASB)\nAlthough I was encouraged when I heard it, I had no clue how clear this would become while I was serving. I was able to reframe missions as my participation in building the most honorable kingdom - the kingdom of God. Missions was not the passion of my past, rather it was restored as a means by which I could walk in the good works God has prepared for me. I want to accept this invitation from the Lord to partake in His masterful building plan for His kingdom.\nBy no means am I saying that missions is the ONLY way to walk in the good works God has prepared for me. That would be to suppose the sacred-secular divide is real, which is not true. I just know that the Holy Spirit empowered me to get excited about sharing my first love with other people.\nHence, I am going back. I am by no means sufficient to carry this out on my own, but I know God‚Äôs power is perfected in my weakness. I just need to act in faith and obedience.\nœáŒ¨œÅŒπœÑŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±·º∞ Œµ·º∞œÅŒÆŒΩŒ∑,\n(grace and peace)\n- Carson\nP.S.

What: This is a place where I plan on sharing my thoughts, experienes, and things I have found to be encouragements in my life! Why: This blog is inspired by my desire to encourage people to follow Jesus. More specifically, I was inspired by a practice my church group did when we were serving in the Czech Republic through an organization called Josiah Venture, where we blogged about our experiences to bring our local church body alongside us our Journey. To Whom: The intended audience for this blog is anyone who is partnering with me in my endeavors to share the gospel with youth. While my intended audience is limited, this blog is actually for anyone and everyone! Please join in praying for me as I prepare to spend my summer as an intern with Josiah Venture! What do you plan on posting here? I hope to share with you my experiences preparing for my JV summer internship, as well as my experiences during the internship. After my time in Czech√≠a, I will be able to reflect on the things that God was showing me along the way!\nI also have ambitions to publish some of my own writing here - mainly about books I want to review, ideas I want to share, and things I would love to invite you to consider!\nWhat is JosiahVenture? Josiah Venture is a para-church missions organization focused on raising up youth leaders in Central and Eastern Europe. Their mission statement can be found on their website, but I‚Äôve retrieved it here for you:\n\u0026#34;This is the vision of Josiah Venture, a vision for a movement of God among the youth of Central and Eastern Europe that finds its home in the local church and transforms society. Our mission and calling is to equip young leaders to fulfill Christ‚Äôs commission by reaching and making disciples. More than just conversion, we want to see passionate followers of Jesus Christ, with a vision to reach and disciple their generation for him.\u0026#34; The heartbeat behind Josiah Venture is actually derived from the story of King Josiah of Israel (read here). He inherits the throne of Israel at age eight. He did what was right in the eyes of God, purged the nation of places reserved for idol worship, and sought to reorient the people to follow God once again. As an organization, Josiah Venture seeks to find and raise up more Josiah‚Äôs across Central and Eastern Europe.\nHow will you be serving? I will be serving alongside the current Josiah Venture missionaries that are already in Czech√≠a by partnering with local churches to promote, plan, and facilitate English Camps across the country.\nCan you give me a preview of what this will look like somehow? I can‚Äôt exactly look into the future, but I imagine it will look similar to the camp I served last summer, when my church in AZ partnered with a local Czech church. Check it out here!\nConclusion I hope I anticipated the questions you might have. If not, feel free to contact me with more questions via the form on the home page. I was led to create this blog in December 2022, and it is super fun to finally see it come to fruition. Glory be to God, and may this page be one that is edifying to all who read it!\nMy hope and prayer is that if you have chosen to let Jesus rule over your life, that you may be spurred on to love and good works (Hebrews 10:24), and that if you do not yet have Jesus as the ruler of your life, that you‚Äôd stick around for the sake of curiosity. After all, I‚Äôll probably be posting more than just summer preparatory items on here! œáŒ¨œÅŒπœÑŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±·º∞ Œµ·º∞œÅŒÆŒΩŒ∑,\n(grace and peace)\n- Carson\n","date":1676073605,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676073605,"objectID":"f6f6692b1fd72cfa76791af88c447ed3","permalink":"https://carsonslater.com/post/welcome/","publishdate":"2023-02-11T00:00:05Z","relpermalink":"/post/welcome/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome! üëã I created this blog to share my thoughts, encouragements, and experiences of my life with God with you!","tags":["Missions","Blog"],"title":"Welcome to my blog!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Carson Slater"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.
