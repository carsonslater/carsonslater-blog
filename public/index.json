I am so thankful for all of you. I am writing this blog post (as well as every subsequent post) from Waco, Texas. I finished my internship with Josiah Venture on August 10, but have since flown to Phoenix, packed up everything I own and moved to Waco, and visited some friends in Arkansas who I met at my first English Camp this summer! So if this update feels far removed from the prior, it is because there has been a lot of time since my last post. Thanks for your thoughts and prayers, and stay tuned as I unpack more of my summer for you!\nImportant Announcement I am hosting a Zoom call on Saturday, September 2, 2023 at 7AM Pacific Standard Time. This is an opportunity to hear it from me about what the summer was like. In this call I’ll give a short presentation, followed by a Q\u0026amp;A. There might be an appearance from my fellow interns Lydia Hanilton (Ireland) and Petr Cvejn (Czech)!\nJoin the meeting here or click here to see invite details in a Google Doc. The password is 436782.\nMission Team Training Since you’ve last heard from me, there has been a lot of things that have conspired. One of those bitter-sweet things has been our final mission team training of the summer! We were situated at a hotel north of Prague for a few days, where we hosted two churches and their mission teams preparing them for English camp. One of the most fun parts of this internship has been meeting people from all over the U.S. who partnered with Josiah Venture and came to mission team training.\nCamp Photo! (This camp was a third of the size of the other two we did) Camp with the Churches These churches were hosting their first ever English camp ever! This made camp a vastly different experience than the prior two camps, where the churches we partnered with had been doing English camps for at least 7 years. Rather than joining this church in ministry, it felt at points we were inviting them into the ministry with the way we were doing things while showing the young believers how things at camp work. I say that it felt this way but in actuality, they were truly inviting us into ministry in their community.\nRelationships One could say this symbiotic dynamic was refreshing, but honestly the biggest challenge I faced at camp was maintaining high energy levels to be present in every moment. It was truly an opportunity to entrust to the Lord the relationships I was forming. My personal bandwidth was approaching its limit throughout the week.\nRegardless, this camp was so fun! It was my first week this whole summer that I taught English and it was so much more fun than I remember it being! Members of my class at the end of camp told one of the missionaries we were with that it was a highlight of camp!\nI had the privilege of hanging out with students who had been displaced by the war in Ukraine at this camp, and it was remarkable to try to model Christ for them in the week that I had! We connected over small things, like high fives, Fortnite dances, and games at camp. For those students, their Czech was amazing, but their English was very poor (one of them told me they learned Czech in just five months - crazy!).\nTwo particular students I was really encouraged by were the students who were the Czech believers (names obfuscated for confidentiality). James was 18 years old, and one of the first questions he asked me thirty minutes into our relationship was my take on why bad things happen to good people. It was a fruitful conversation, and it basically set the tone for our relationship the whole week. Beyond intense questions discussed, we built on similar senses of humor, and I was able to empower him to investigate his big questions and use resources at his fingertips.\nAnother one I was encouraged by was Riley, who was actually an older camper who had a hunger for Christian community. He was an amazing athlete who was creating culture in his community through spikeball. I am thankful for connecting with him and excited to see how God uses his giftings in the future.\nHow I Saw God Moving Overall, this camp is definitely a situation where I will not see fruit borne until years in the future, but the fact that I was able to join this church and train them on how to do a Josiah Venture English camp was an amazing opportunity and a huge honor. This camp was particularly difficult to navigate spiritually, as many students were not believers. We were trying to love them as Christ would, and part of that was leaning into opportunities to share the gospel with them at evening program. At this camp I was able to give a camp talk about who Jesus is, and also share my testimony the last full day of camp.\nArt work from one of the believers at camp. Sometimes you share the gospel and people’s hearts are softened, and other times their hearts are calloused. This camp definitely felt like there were a lot more students in the latter circumstance, but it was interesting because they loved our staff as people. Though students were not agreeable to …","date":1692576005,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692576005,"objectID":"0c3616cb31acf0b7309c08ce0714b72f","permalink":"https://carsonslater.com/post/weeks910/","publishdate":"2023-08-21T00:00:05Z","relpermalink":"/post/weeks910/","section":"post","summary":"Recapping Weeks 9 and 10","tags":["Missions","Blog"],"title":"Řicany/Neratovice!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Carson Slater"],"categories":["Blog"],"content":"Overview …And then there was term two of camps! I am writing this on one of my off-days in Ostrava. From mission team training until now, I have been able to be a part of many special things, all of which are a part of God’s Plan.\nResting with the fellow JV Czech interns! Rest Being a part of an English camp is such a rich, yet taxing experience… Being a part of three English camps is even more rich, yet taxing. So as interns, we spent an entire day just sleeping… Which was warranted, and then we crafted a tradition of hitting up a Nepalese restaurant before each camp!\nMission Team Training at Malenovice. Mission Team Training Mission team training was such a joy! This was our second session of the summer, so the good news is that there was not a lot that needed to be prepared ahead of time for this training. The other news is that for myself, mission team trainings have proved to be exhausting times. During these trainings, I generally have more responsibilities throughout the day, and for a lot of evening program I tend to be doing something (ranging from leading the camp dance, to doing skits and icebreakers). I had to learn how to steward my energy well during this time. Please pray for this next training this week, that I can steward my energy well! There needs to be a balance between conserving my energy for camp, and leaning into the mission teams to encourage them for their ministry.\nFamiliar faces were a part of my American team! English Camp This particular English Camp was special to me because of how familiar it was for me. It was also at the same place as mission team training, which was really convenient! This exact camp was the first Josiah Venture camp I was a part of last summer, and is one of the reasons I heavily considered doing this internship. Unlike the first camp, I was surrounded by not only people from my own home (the Family Bible Church American team), but also many of the campers had returned from last year’s camp! Additionally, I noticed a few campers who had come from the school that I visited a few weeks ago in the same region.\nLast camp was in the region of northeast Bohemia, but this camp is in a very unique region of the Czech Republic called Silesia. This particular region has a unique history because it has been fought over by Czechs, Austrians, and Poles for centuries. Currently, it is Czech, but many people speak Czech, Polish, and a language called Po našymu. It is a language that combines Czech, Slovakian, German and Polish.\nIt was so good to serve alongside the familiar faces, and experience even a different culture within the Czech Republic. For some campers, I picked up right where I left off. For this camp, there were some students I knew were not believers, so it was good to talk to them about the gospel again to see how their attitudes had developed toward it after a year. Although these conversations were rich, many of these students still seemed hardened to it. I began to focus more on investing in relationships with the Czech leaders about halfway through the week, to empower and encourage them to continue to follow up with the non-yet-saved students after camp! Please pray for them as they continue in their ministry throughout the year!\nSpiritual Warfare Both camps this summer have been filled with forthright spiritual warfare. Satan for whatever reason is not trying to hide what he is doing. This particular camp was difficult for the leadership team due to constant news of health issues for close friends and family. Though this blog is not the place to share all of the details, there were a few prayer sessions throughout the week that we as a team were able to have. It was amazing to see God providing peace to those affected! In retrospect, these were not distractions but opportunities to trust in the Lord in the midst of our service!\nEpické Vzpomínky (Epic Memories) This camp was so fun to be a part of for a second time! My discussion group was full of students from the church, so it was good to challenge them with slightly deeper questions about the evening talks. We even came up with a group name, called “the freezer,” as we claimed to be the “coolest” discussion group.\nAdditionally, there were so many fun things we partook in - a hike to summit the tallest mountain in the region, a water day, a waterfall hike, many sports and English classes, a functional fitness workshop led by yours truly, a head-to-head soccer game with another English camp, and more!\nOne thing to keep in mind is that this ministry is one part of a church’s annual ministry. For that reason, I see it as an extremely valueable outreach event for students in their community. Not only is it a place where students can hear the gospel for the first time, but it is also a place where students who have never been connected with the mládež (youth group) can build relationships with those who are a part of the church.\nOverall, it was amazing to see God moving in the hearts of the students who …","date":1690156805,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690156805,"objectID":"9b3d80d6585c7db92b28ecedd761fbdb","permalink":"https://carsonslater.com/post/weeks78/","publishdate":"2023-07-24T00:00:05Z","relpermalink":"/post/weeks78/","section":"post","summary":"Recapping Weeks 7 and 8","tags":["Missions","Blog"],"title":"Český Těšín!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Carson Slater"],"categories":["Blog"],"content":"Overview Hey everyone! I am so tardy on this blog post and I apologize greatly. Thank you for your patience. These past two weeks have been phenomenal, and I have so much to unpack for you all. Hang tight for the sequence of events!\nMission Team Training June 27, we arrived back at Josiah Venture’s training center near Frydlant, CZ at Malenovice. We were joined by four mission teams from different parts of the United States where they were given tips and protocol for how to do life well at camp.\nDave Patty (President of Josiah Venture) giving an evening talk at mission team training. We taught them how to teach English well, lead discussion groups, understand Czech culture, and handle potential camp issues. Each day consisted of seminars, camp dance practice, workshops, free time, and the infamous evening program.\nFor those who have never worked with Josiah Venture before, evening program is the climax of each day at camp, where there are high-energy songs, games, dances, skits, all building up to an evening talk with a gospel presentation. At mission team training, we put on our own evening program where we gave mission teams a glimpse into what each evening would look like for them at camp. As an intern, most of the things in evening program are my responsibility, minus the talk, so that was probably my most busiest time during training.\nSunset at JV training center Malenovice. Overall mission team training was great because I was able to bond with the mission teams, especially the one I tagged along to do camp with.\nArriving at Camp June 30, we hopped on a train for 5 hours to where camp was, which was near the CB church in Bystre. For context, Bystre is in the northeast part of Bohemia, and so it is kind of in the center of the Czech Republic but more north. The American team typically arrives at camp a day or so before camp actually starts to set up the campground, and make final preparations. One of my responsibilities was to help make the camp rules video. (You should watch it!) We ended up making a parody of a-ha’s Take on Me. This video was played during the first evening program to highlight the do’s and don’t’s of camp.\nCamp Highlights Watch the official camp recap video here! According to the Czech church people, this was the most students they had ever had for English camp! There were almost 70 students. Each day of camp, students could sign up for a morning activity, which could be either English class, a music workshop, a hike, or a sports activity. After lunch, there were different afternoon workshops containing games, useful skills, or talks. There was always an afternoon activity which involved team games, or water-activities, and evening program started after dinner. After each evening program, the whole camp split into discussion groups to process the content of the evening talk, and finally there was always a night time activity starting at 10pm.\nFor myself, I mostly led the morning sports workshops, but one morning I was asked to lead the music workshop! Of all the sports workshops, the Czechs seemed to enjoy the American sports the most (baseball and American football).\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Your browser does not support the video tag. Afternoon workshops were a blast! From cooking workshops by a masterchef competitor, to a workshops on how to travel well, to crocheting, we offered a lot of different options for the students to gain random useful skills. One afternoon workshop I hosted was a specialty coffee workshop. The camp director had me and a local coffee barista come and teach people how to think about, buy, and brew specialty coffee! It was super cool and I actually learned a few new brewing methods from my Czech coffee counterpart, although I must say he was far more advanced than me.\nYour browser does not support the video tag. This particular English camp really impressed me with all of the creativity that went into planning the afternoon activities, we did fun minigames, but we also had thematic games, such as the squid games (based off the Netflix series) and a game based off the 10 plagues of Egypt.\nEvening programs were super energetic. The students I talked to all agreed that the camp dance was one of the most fun and energizing parts of camp. We also had the camp songs, led by yours truly and my fellow intern Lydia. Worship followed camp songs, which led up to each evening talk.\nFirst evening program of the week!!! This year, the camp theme is “Part of the Plan,” and all of the camp talks go through part of the redemptive arc of Scripture, starting in Genesis, and ending in the church age. Each evening, there is a different main topic, ranging from God’s created design, to sin, to how God wants to restore hearts to follow Him. Each talk is followed by a discussion group time where students are given an opportunity to unpack what they thought about the talk.\nGod was moving all week, even in times when it did not seem clear to me!

As I write this, there are three mission teams en route to Krakow, Poland, where they will be greeted by JV missionaries who are ready to take them to their mission team training! As an intern, responsibilities at mission team training is a huge part of my job. I am so excited to get the ball rolling! Before we cover that, I should recap my week for you!\nGarden Party Although I may be a Josiah Venture intern, I am actually working for an organization called KAM (Křesťanská Akademie Mladých - Christian Youth Academy), which is one of the many national organizations under Josiah Venture. For the past few summers, KAM has had a small get-together where all of the Czech national missionaries meet at the Josiah Venture conference center. This was actually a really refreshing experience for me, as I got to meet a TON of missionaries that serve here in Czechia, and I got to hear story after story of how God has moved in their lives. Although the gathering was only for an evening, I had so much fun!\nCatching up with Josh Dietz at Garden Party. Three people I really was excited to talk with were Josh Dietz, Brad Kaspar, and Tomáš Zářický.\nJosh was my initial JV connection, so it is always good to see him and catch up. Brad Kaspar tapped me on the shoulder, seeing I was wearing a Wheaton shirt, and told me he was a class of ‘02 alumni! That was a really cool experience, and I got to hear his story and share mine with him. He moved to Czechia as a single missionary in 2005, and he continues to serve in regional work with his wife! Lastly, I met Tomáš Zářický at intern training, and he has been the biggest hype man. His energy is unmatched and so appreciated. I enjoyed getting to chat with him again and pray for him (he might be going to Ukraine to do camps later this summer)!\nOne Last Time with C-Team Being a Czechia intern for JV has its perks, and one of them is that we are close to all of the main Josiah Venture people. They all live here on the east side of Czechia! For most intern teams, they are the only ones in their countries, but we Czech camp interns have been able to bond with the JV communications interns!\nOne last get-together with the JV communications team interns. Unfortunately, our last get-together happened this past week, because four of the six of them left on a long trip to visit JV camps all over Europe to create content and capture moments from the summer. We had such a good time with them though!\nSeen in Brno 👀 Hanging out in the square in Brno. Our last off-day featured a trip to the second biggest city in Czechia: Brno! It was a great time, where I actually got to catch up with two people who were leaders at my first ever English Camp last summer!\nSeeing friends from last year’s camp in Brno! Český Těšín Visit For church on Sunday, it was so great to visit the church who my home church partners with, CB Český Těšín! I got to see my home-stay visit family from last year, and I got to connect with lots of people who will be at our second English camp.\nFinal Preparations Camp is on the horizon, and from here on out, the summer is going to look a lot more fast-paced! As far as I know, we interns are ready for mission team training, and also for camp! I’ve been trying to get ahead in the work that I need to do, preparing devotionals and icebreaker games, but there is only so much we can do!\nDrinking wayyyyy too much nitro cold brew during camp preparation. Prayer Requests I’d love if you joined us in our ministry by praying over us! Some things that we would love you to join us in petitioning the Lord for are:\nFor mission team training to serve its purpose in preparing the teams to do a long week and a half of camp ministry. That God may continue to purify our hearts from day to day. That we as interns can integrate well into the various camp leadership teams and structures. For strength, energy and focus during the fast-paced nature of our internship. For wisdom in navigating gospel conversations. For students to have an open heart toward the gospel. That we as interns may be effective in meeting students where they are at, to love on them. Also, I have so many photos to share! I’ll pick some key ones to showcase on the page, but you can visit the album directly below:\nClick Here for This Week’s Photo Dump! χάριτος καἰ εἰρήνη,\n(grace and peace)\n- Carson\n","date":1687824005,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687824005,"objectID":"39a351791719f471f59d283bbb99da7d","permalink":"https://carsonslater.com/post/week4/","publishdate":"2023-06-27T00:00:05Z","relpermalink":"/post/week4/","section":"post","summary":"Week 4 Recap","tags":["Missions","Blog"],"title":"Camp Season is Upon Us!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Carson Slater"],"categories":["Blog"],"content":"Week Threeeeee “Father, make of me a crisis man. Bring those I contact to decision. Let me not be a milepost on a single road; make me a fork, that men must turn one way or another on facing Christ in me.”1\nAs I alluded in my last post, this week was full of travel! I think I have gone on 12 train rides in the past 7 days (Europe is kind of epic for having infrastructure like this). We three amigos (the Czech interns - or Czechterns hehe) met so many amazing people to touch base with before we do camp with all of them in a few weeks!\nTrain ride back from Neratovice. How God is Moving in My Heart I failed to mention this in the last post, but I got to work out with JV Edge Sports leader, Casey Yorman in his garage the previous two Mondays. During our last lift, he was gracious enough to ask me how I saw God meeting me during this time in Czechia. As a verbal processor, it was a prime opportunity to process what God was doing, and I’d love to share it with you here!\nComing into the internship, I was in the midst of a LOT of transition. Undergrad had just ended for me - many close friends were shot like arrows all over the world to do kingdom work. Realities I thought were going to be the case ended up not working out, and there was a lot of brokenness in the circumstances around me.\nIn that brokenness God met me and He reminded me that my suffering was a means to make me more whole. Through my emotional suffering, God helped me love Him more, drawing me to Himself. His love was the only thing I could certainly cling to. He proved to be my ‘rock.’\nGod did more than remind me of His promises. When I sought the Lord, I was reminded of His heart for creation, and how He wants to restore it! He gave me a glimpse into His heart and enabled me to take on the same posture.\nAnd he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.”2\nOkay, so God not only reminded me of His promises and how He is making all things new, but also He INVITES me into that renewal process as a co-laborer. This is the highest honor, and my internship experience has made this so apparent.\nŘíčany Visit Říčany is a north suburb about 30 minutes north of Prague via train. We were able to go into the grammar school there, and promote English camp just as we did in Český Těšín. Students there were so lively - praise God! I was even asked several times, “You’re an American, what are you doing in Říčany?” I love this question, because it gives me an opportunity to share the gospel. I even got to share why I am in Czechia in a school visit class!\nWe them met up with the pastor of their church, and met two of the youth group members which was very excited. We have fellowship over barbecue, which made me very excited to do camp with them (not because of the BBQ, in case you were wondering).\nNeratovice Visit Getting to know one of the youth group members from Neratovice! After the Říčany school visit, we were able to stay with the pastor of the Neratovice church (30 mins south of Prague), who was so hospitable! We had school visits the next day, and the students were very intrigued by the idea of English camp, because they haven’t had one in their region for a long time (or ever?).\nWe were asked by the pastor to lead the youth group that same night, because he and his family needed to attend a funeral. God knew what He was doing, because we decided to play some icebreaker games, worship together, and have a discussion on Luke 15:1-7.\nTwo of the students (who are not believers) were attending the group for the first time, and they had told my fellow intern Lydia that at our group was the first time they had ever read the Bible. What an honor it was to introduce the students to Scripture for the first time!\nBystre Visit The next day we were able to go to youth group (in Czechia, youth group is called “mladez”) for Petr’s home church in Bystre where we will be doing our first camp. It was great to connect with the youth at that church, because we have a relational foundation to start with before we begin camp.\nMladez at Bystre We were treated with much kindness and hospitality at Bystre, and discussed ideas for the camp. Sunday in Bystre was also a joy, where we got to stand up in the service and share our excitement for camp. We invited the congregation to pray for camp, and for God to draw people to Himself. I’d love to invite you into the same thing!\nGetting to know leaders at Bystre. Prep for Camp Upcoming we have a one-day JV-Czech (KAM) conference, followed by five more days to prepare for camp. I will be preparing devotionals, English camp materials, ice-breaker games, worship sets, and resting during this time! Camp season is intense, so please pray that our team can communicate, collaborate, and rest well during the camps. We want to be fresh to build relationships and lean into gospel conversation.\nPreparing for English Camp!

Men from 18-50 are being drafted every day to fight in the war, and we would do well as Christians to pray for them as they experience oppression. Pray that the Russians would relent from their agenda, and for the people in Russia as well!\nLife in Ostrava For the next month, my home base has become a dormitory in Ostrava, the third biggest city in the Czech Republic. Lots of the JV missionaries live in Ostrava but do ministry all over the surrounding region of Moravia and Silesia. We, as interns are no exception. This week has been nice to get our feet underneath us, but we have been doing lots of preparation for camp. Lots of my free time has been devoted to prepping English class materials for all three levels (Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced). Other time has been spent brainstorming ice-breaker games, crafting devotionals, and doing intern team-building exercises. We even had a CliftonStrengths Strengthfinders consulting session with a certified coach, who happens to be my intern director’s wife!\nPasta party with fellow interns Petr and Lydia. School Visits! On Friday, we traveled to Český Těšín, where we taught six forty-five minute class periods of English basics in the public school. We led games and also promoted camp with flyers, and I even got to share a presentation of where I am from - Arizona! The students were particularly interested in the pictures I had of the desert landscape, because it is so different than the landscape here.\nRest Day Saturday was our rest day, where we took a team trip to the mountains of Slovakia! There we hiked through beautiful ravines, and rock crevices. It was green and a very refreshing time with the team (literally - it rained!).\nTeam hike on our off day! More Preparation This upcoming week we are hitting the road to promote camp on the other side of the country. Our third camp this summer is being hosted by two churches working together in the Prague area, and it will be the first year they have ever done an English Camp! As a result, we will be much more hands-on with this English Camp and have to walk the church through what doing one of these camps look like. They have smaller youth groups, but we are hoping the school visits in their areas on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday will get students in their communities excited about English Camp. So, Tuesday is another administrative day (prepping for teaching English does take many hours) where we will be gearing up for English classes and the upcoming school visits.\nWorking hard on English Class preparation (and this blog post). I will also be preparing for Mission Team Training, where we will train the short-term American teams that are coming to support these English Camps. For these trainings, we can share how these short-term teams can be the most effective in the camps ministry while still being good stewards of their own bandwidth.\nPrayer Requests I’d love if you joined us in our ministry by praying over us! Some things that we would love you to join us in petitioning the Lord for are:\nThat the Lord may bring more students to English camps through our school visits. There are many logistical things that are still unresolved about our summer. Pray that God would help us steward our time here well. Pray that God will show us a faster and more effective way to prepare for English classes. Thanking God that our team is really growing closer together and more comfortable with each other. Pray that our local churches with whom we are partnering can prepare for English camps well. Especially the churches near Prague! Pray for the American mission teams that are coming to our English camps. Pray for students to have an open heart toward the gospel.

I arrived at the airport in Krakow, Poland with one of my fellow interns, Petr, a JV Czech staff member, Baru, and my intern director, Josh, via bus on Thursday, June 1st. There we met up with our final team member Lydia who flew in from northern Ireland! From there, we started on the JV Amazing Race, which took us throughout the city of Krakow. We encountered challenges that were designed to build up team chemistry, uncover strengths and weaknesses of individuals, and teach us about Josiah Venture and Polish culture. After spending the night in a Krakow hostel and running through some obstacles Friday in Krakow, we took a bus to Český Těšín, where we finished the race (I felt like I had home court advantage low key).\nIn case you were wondering, we were in eighth place out of fourteen after day 1, and finished in fifth!\nSome noteworthy race features were:\nFinding specific plants in The Botanical Garden of the Jagiellonian University, Riding the Krakow Eye Puzzles regarding famous Polish music composer’s Chopin’s Nocturne No.20 in C sharp minor, An epic scavenger hunt all over Krakow, with many items requiring us to talk to strangers, Taking a picture from the overlook at Těšín, Learning how to wash clothes in a sink in Český Těšín, Learning the camp dance, and more! Overall this race was an opportunity for me to gel with my intern team, and I am so thankful for the memorable experience. Running and debriefing it was a huge opportunity to set ourselves up for success over the summer.\nAfter the race, I ‘ran into’ one of the elders from my Arizona church, Doug Sandy! That was super cool. Doug was the leader of my first trip to Czechia last summer, and he was visiting the church we did our camp with last summer as a short-term team.\nSeeing Doug and our friend Radek in Český Těšín. Intern Training After the race we traveled to Josiah Venture’s retreat center where we began intern training!\nIntern training at Malenovice! I’d be dishonest if I said that intern training was a breeze. There were many challenges that presented themselves that were opportunities to rely on the Lord. While learning about various topics like the gospel in Europe, team dynamics, culture, healthy conflict resolution, and intern expectations, God was preparing me emotionally to lean on Him this whole summer. Praise God for His subtle (or not so subtle) ways of reminding us of Christ’s supremacy!\nI saw God moving in the hearts of the interns around me too. There were so many fruitful discussions where other interns were able to share their excitements and concerns about the summer ahead of them in their respective countries. I made a few more friends too at intern training, some of whom I will be praying for throughout the whole summer!\nHow am I feeling heading into ministry? As a perfectionist, I know I will never be ‘ready’ in the sense that I feel most secure; however, I was itching to engage youth and students by the end of intern training. I am so excited for the coming weeks as I prepare for camps, visit schools to promote camps, and encourage local long-term missionaries! I pray that God may go prepare the way for us as our camps teams prepare.\n“The gospel also reminds me that my righteous standing with God always holds firm regardless of my performance, because my standing is based solely on the work of Jesus and not mine. On my worst days of sin and failure, the gospel encourages me with God’s unrelenting grace toward me. On my best days of victory and usefulness, the gospel keeps me relating to God solely on the basis of Jesus’ righteousness and not mine.1”\nPrayer Requests I’d love if you joined us in our ministry by praying over us! Some things that we would love you to join us in petitioning the Lord for are:\nThat the Lord may bring more students to English camps through our school visits. That our team may continue to gel together and build up one another. That our local churches with whom we are partnering can prepare for English camps well. For the American mission teams that are coming to our English camps. For students to have an open heart toward the gospel. That we as interns may be effective in meeting students where they are at, to love on them. Thank You! If you are reading this, I want to THANK YOU!!! Your support and prayer means so much to me!

We partnered with a church near the Polish border and helped with their annual English Camp. Thankfully, we did not just dive straight into the camp, unprepared. We did months of preparation on the front end of the trip, and even a couple days of training in Prague upon arrival.\nDuring our training, we were not only given time to overcome jet lag, but we were also introduced to Josiah Venture’s discipleship training material. I thought it would be helpful to share it with you all since it is the abstract paradigm through which I will be operating this summer as I minister to high school students!\nAs a disclaimer, the first two of these challenges first happen to people who have not yet repented and believed (i.e. nonbelievers). Every person who is in Christ encounters these five challenges in their life!\nThe Five Challenges of Christ Okay, so obviously Jesus gave more than five challenges to disciples and others alike during the incarnation, but this framework has been what Josiah Venture has been using to train others to disciple during their camps ministry. I have found it very digestible, actionable, and easy to remember. I think it is cool too because I see parallels between Jesus’s words in Scripture and a Biblical Theology of Mission (spoiler alert).\n1. Come and See In the first chapter of John, before Jesus began His ministry, we saw Him calling men to look at and entertain what He was doing.\n“[Jesus] said to them, ‘Come and you will see.’”1\nJesus (God incarnate) was drawing people to Himself. Is this new? Nope.\nThink about ancient Israel! They had a ’limited’ mission - to be a covenant community designed to mediate the presence of God on a sinful and rebellious earth. Israel did not reject foreigners dwelling among them, insofar as these foreigners did not lead the Israelites astray, but they were certainly not evangelistic.\nIn order for discipleship in my life to take place, I must first come and see what God is doing. How can I give a reason for the hope that is within me, if I have not begun personally witness what the Lord is doing?\n2. Repent and Believe Discipleship does not stop with acknowledging God. Anyone who is in Christ is a new creation! When Jesus came to earth, He began His ministry saying,\n“The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe the gospel.”2\nWhat is this mysterious ‘kingdom’ language Jesus is using? Why is it grounds to repent and believe the gospel?\nThis is because the kingdom life is the life Jesus himself embodied and inaugurated.3\nYou see, Jesus could say that ’the kingdom of God is at hand’ because He was standing in their midst. Jesus not only made the perfect atonement for the sin of humanity, but He also embodied the lives God designed His people to live. Because the embodiment of the kingdom life was at hand, the kingdom of God was also at hand by extension. This is why when He started his ministry, He invited people to take on this kingdom life.\nIn order for us to take on this new life, repentance is necessary. A godly sorrow for sin, and a turning away from things that displease God are key components of this. A bold faith in the truth and power of the gospel is of equal importance. Only then, when I understand what life with and in Christ means, can I begin to show others what it is about.\n3. Follow Me “As Jesus went on from there, He saw a man called Matthew, sitting in the tax collector’s booth; and He said to him, ‘Follow Me!’ And he got up and followed Him. Then it happened that as Jesus was reclining at the table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were dining with Jesus and His disciples.”4\nRepentance and belief in the gospel are not a single, one-time events. Perhaps you can argue that the resolution to repent and believe in the gospel is, but repentance and belief are daily decisions. When someone consistently makes the daily decision to repent and believe in the gospel with a genuine sincerity, one can say they are following Jesus!\nFollowing Jesus requires faithfulness. This component of faithfulness pertains to steadfastness. We can be faithful in one sense, where we believe in the gospel, but we can also be faithful in the other sense, where we had steadfast, unwavering belief.\nIn this phase a person begins to understand what life with God truly looks like.\n4. Fish for Men I too can invite people to ‘come and see’ what God is doing – both on a personal and corporate level. This is one way we can mediate the presence of God on earth, as His royal priesthood.\n“And [Jesus] said to them, ‘Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.’”5\nThis invitation to ‘fish for men,’ is a challenge to invite people to come and see, repent and believe, and follow Jesus!\nOne of my favorite examples in Scripture of this is the first four of these challenges in action, demonstrated in two verses. Paul writes to Timothy,\n“You …","date":1685750405,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685750405,"objectID":"c62759c4ef0dd365fe65c273765c9b30","permalink":"https://carsonslater.com/post/discipleship/","publishdate":"2023-06-03T00:00:05Z","relpermalink":"/post/discipleship/","section":"post","summary":"'And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.'","tags":["Missions","Blog"],"title":"A Model of Discipleship","type":"post"},{"authors":["Carson Slater"],"categories":["Blog"],"content":"Today marks day one of my summer in Europe! It as been quite a crazy couple of weeks for myself. I aspired to write a few posts between when I posted my last one and now; however, perpetual circumstance in this season of transition did not relent. Here are a few moments I was able to be a part of in the past couple of weeks:\nTwo beautiful weddings for some of my favorite people! My own undergraduate commencement. My sister’s high school graduation (shout out to Carolyn). Tender coversations with friends. Packing up everything I own to prepare to move to Texas after my JV internship. It feels as though my college graduation was yesterday, but at the same time, I was itching to get on the plane to Europe.\nGod is moving. Although my post-grad time has been short and I have scarcely had time to process and reflect, here are some things that God has been laying on my heart:\nSuffering and joy are intuitively thought of as inversely proportional. Although suffering does not ellicit a joyful response in of itself, there is a perspective toward suffering we obtain once we are united with Christ that shows us that it is God’s workmanship perfecting us, making us whole. Lately, I have been learning how to grieve well! My missionary summer internship is so significant, but not ultimate. It is also a part of God’s greater plan to redeem and restore humanity, just like your workday, or your friendships! We have a role to play in the main story, but we are not the main story. This summer will be an amazing learning experience. I am so excited! I want to abide in Christ, as I am united with Him in His death and resurrection. Perichoresis is the theological term for how the persons of the trinity relates to each other. It is though of as a dance - I too want to dance with God in this beautiful, messy, but calculated manner, letting him lead me. My salvation is my invitation into this dance with God! Looking Ahead Upon touchdown in Prague I will (Lord willing) be picked up by Josh Dietz, my original connection to Josiah Venture, and I will hop on a train to Ostrava, Czechia. After spending the night with my intern director, I will head to Krakow on a bus to start the Josiah Venture Amazing Race, a part of intern training! Stay tuned for fun stories.\nAn Invitation to Prayer I’d love to invite you to prayer over:\nMy intern team as we learn how to encourage one another and work as a team. My intern director, Josh Nelson, as he will be leading us the whole summer. The camps ministry for Josiah Venture, and all of the students who are going to be coming to camp!

As a part of my internship preparation, my intern director, Josh Nelson (shout out to Josh) encouraged me to read Henry Nouwen’s In the Name of Jesus. So, I decided to write this post to invite all who are praying for me into what I am processing before my internship!\nFrom the moment I picked up this book, I knew it would be a convicting read. For those who do not know, Henry Nouwen is a prominent scholar who specialized in Christian ministry and ministerial psychology. Prior to writing this book, he served as a faculty member at Notre Dame’s, Yale’s and Harvard’s Divinity schools.\nWhy do I allude to my sense of conviction? Well, the introduction recounts Nouwen’s decision to leave academia in exchange for priesthood within a L’Arche community (click here to learn more about L’Arche).\nTo make matters more intense, the day I began to read this book, my pastor had literally given a sermon on how God is the one who reminds us of the dignity of the vulnerable, and that people’s humanity does not come from their accomplishments, wealth, social capital, or abilities to aquire these things. A person’s embodiment is enough to warrant dignity, because it means they have the Imago Dei! So I digress, I was interested to read this book and hear Nouwen’s perspective.\nI was also drawn in because I personally was invited to visit and spend an evening with a L’Arche community my freshman year of college. Anecdotally, I remember being uncomfortable the whole time, but God has used those memories to redeem and formulate not only a posture of love toward the vulnerable but also a deep commitment to uphold the dignity of handicapped people. Looking back on my reflection assignment, I have come so far, but if I could rewrite that assignment again, I would iterate that we would do well to have constant exposure from all kinds of people in our lives, including the mentally handicapped. They provide a piece of the Imago Dei that we would not otherwise have known, and they provide opportunities for us to invite them into Christian community.\nWhat Struck Me Being ‘Relevant’ In the first section of the book, Nouwen describes the insecurities he experienced upon entering the L’Arche community. Being an academic with some of the brightest students the world has to offer, he describes deeply feeling the contrast. He writes:\n“Not being able to use any of the skills that have proved so practical in the past was a real source of anxiety. I was suddenly faced with my naked self, open for affirmations and rejections, hugs and punches, smiles and tears, all dependent simply on how I was perceived at the moment. In a way, it seemed as though I was starting my life all over again.”\nI deeply resonated with this, feeling similarly about exiting a context recently where I spend so much time and had many talents (i.e. playing baseball). The truth I reflected upon while engaging this writing is that nothing is wasted, even though sometimes I feel I have had no preparation for the things being thrown at me.\nNouwen took this notion a step further, to point out how he wanted to give into the temptation to rely on his accolates and be ‘relevant.’ The thing is about L’Arche communities though, is that being a Harvard professor does not help you acquire much social capital. Stepping into this new community for Nouwen was an opportunity to fall back on His true identity as a Son of God, rather than an accomplished academic.\nI can anticipate myself experiencing this same temptation this summer in a foreign culture. I do not think that most students at my camps will care that I played NCAA baseball, or am entering a Statistics PhD program. These are great things, but temporal, transient features of my short time on this side of heaven. I pray I can meet students where they are at, giving up my desire to be ‘relevant.’\nSearching for Love in the Wrong Places Nouwen claims our desire to be ‘relevant’ is inextricably tied to our desire to be loved. Naturally, we crave love from the people around us whom we deem significant in our lives (parents, children, spouses, friends), but Nouwen points out this love as secondary to the true love – the “first love” found in our intimate relationship with God. Love within interpersonal relationships are often the source of frustration, resentment, and anger, but God’s love is untainted and abundantly more than sufficient.\n“The radical good news is that the second love is only a broken reflection of the first love, and that the first love is offered to us by a God, in whom there are no shadows. Jesus’s heart is the incarnation of the shadow-free first love of God.”\nWhat does it truly mean to live each day, knowing you are beloved?\nNouwen takes to mysticism as the answer. (Christian) Mysticism is where a person is keenly aware of the love of God, via various spiritual practices. I believe Julian of Norwich is the default mystic most people think of, knowing about her work, …","date":1683676805,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683676805,"objectID":"98f4285a7dfb47a95edfe735410c9421","permalink":"https://carsonslater.com/post/nouwen/","publishdate":"2023-05-10T00:00:05Z","relpermalink":"/post/nouwen/","section":"post","summary":"Reflections on my reading of Henri Nouwen's *In the Name of Jesus*","tags":["Book Review","Blog"],"title":"In the Name of Jesus","type":"post"},{"authors":["Carson Slater"],"categories":["Blog"],"content":"I have great news! By the grace of God, I have been able to raise all of the necessary funds to spend the entire summer in the Czech Republic! Thank you to everyone who chose to contribute financially! I want to continue to invite you into deeper relationship via mutual prayer and encouragement. Praise be to God! He is so faithful. This season has been a season full of His provision. Here are some things you can be praying for:\nPray for the missionaries who are promoting the camps right now in the Czech Republic! Pray for the churches who are putting together the camps. There are a lot of logistical details that need to be worked out. Pray that the Lord will bring ease and peace to those people making those decisions. Pray that the other interns on my team can be supported! If you were planning on giving to me but have not yet done so, I encourage you to support the other two interns who will be serving with me throughout the summer, Petr and Lydia! Pray for intern directors who are organizing provisions for my team and myself, that they would be able to do this with ease! Lastly, pray for the war in Ukraine 🇺🇦. We as Christians would do well to petition the Lord for peace. I am so excited to see how the Lord is going to work this summer. I am also grateful that He has invited all of us into participating in His kingdom work.\nHaving BOLD Faith Over my spring break (a month ago), I was feeling the weight of my future. I was wrestling with the uncertainty that lay ahead of me. My good friend would say that I was aware God is on His throne, but I was not trusting in that His plan is what is best for me and for His glory.\nWhile in Arizona a little over a month ago, I went for a walk. I was praying and was prompted to read Mark 9.\nThe narrative begins in verse 14. Jesus was just coming down the mountain after the transfiguration, when he was bombarded by a crowd of people. They were originally surrounding the disciples who had not ascended the mountain with Jesus. A demon-possessed boy was brought before Jesus, who was told his disciples could not cast the demon out of the boy. Verses 20-24 read:\n“They brought the boy to Him. When he saw Him, immediately the spirit threw him into a convulsion, and falling to the ground, he began rolling around and foaming at the mouth. And He asked his father, “How long has this been happening to him?” And he said, “From childhood. It has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, take pity on us and help us!’ And Jesus said to him, ‘If You can? All things are possible to him who believes.’ Immediately the boy’s father cried out and said, `I do believe; help my unbelief.\u0026#39;”\nAfter reading this, I wept. I couldn’t help but notice how the boy’s father had said “If You can do anything…” I was faced with the reality that too often, when I ask the Lord for things, I possess a posture of doubt. “God, if you can…[insert petition].” The problem with this is if I truly believe sanctification looks like my desires growing more consistent with the Lord’s desires, then I should have no problem believing that God can and will grant my petitions.\nI need to be mindful to walk the line between being comfortable and full of faith in my prayers, yet acknowledging that God is so much more than a granter of requests. Our end game is to be united with Him in His death and resurrection, and to embody Him to others so that they might come to know Him. Part of this looks like our desires becoming His. If this is the case, I can boldly approach His throne with full confidence, acknowledging that He is faithful! (Hebrews 4:16)\nThanks be to God Thanks be to God for this opportunity to be a part of this summer ministry. The Lord is more than capable of anything we can ask or imagine. I want to thank everyone who has chosen to support me via financial provisions or prayer, and I would love to invite you into more prayer.

As I am spending my summer doing missions in Europe, and I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into how missions fits into God’s overarching plan to redeem humanity.\nI would love to point out that although this article has everything to do with what I am doing this summer, it simultaneously has nothing to do with the specific particularities of my summer. My reflections on mission are simply an exercise of preparation as I gear up for the coming season. Hence, this post most definitely will feel a little more dry if you are expecting something personal. I hope you find that reflecting on God’s holistic plan introduces a new, vibrant lens that showcases the significance of our day to day ministry tasks we engage in.\nThe Point Doing theology for the sake of the intellectual stimulation, or knowledge acquisition, can be profitable and well intented; however, the reason I write this article is to invite people to know God. Knowing God is infinitely more valuable than having wrestled with all theological topics and concepts.\nTheology is an opportunity to better understand and seek God for the sake of intimacy. My prayer for this article is that if you read this, you may be introduced to a new or better understanding of the epic plan for God’s people, and maybe catch a new glimpse of the Planner Himself.\nWhat is Biblical Theology? I remember the first time I had heard the phrase, ‘Biblical Theology’ in a Christian circle. Naively, my knee jerk reaction was: “Isn’t all Theology Biblical?”\nIt turns out that I was wrong, at least in one sense. What I ended up learning is that there are different ways of doing theology. There are different approaches that can be taken to learning about God. To quote Andrew David Naselli,\n“Biblical theology is a way of analyzing and synthesizing the Bible that makes organic, salvation-historical connections with the whole canon on its own terms, especially how the Old and New Testaments progress, integrate, and climax in Christ.”1\nAs a shortcut, the framework I like to use to think about biblical theology is by comparing it to other ways of doing theology. At its core, biblical theology, systematic theology, and historical theology are all avenues of studying God, but they are distinct in their own right. Historical theology is beautiful because it heavily considers and analyzes church history and theological development. Systematic theology presupposes questions and goes to Scriputre for answers, for the sake of building a robust framework to think about God. Biblical Theology, on the other hand, is exegesis in light of the whole Scripture. Biblical Theology uses the historical narrative of the Bible, and allows Scripture to raise questions about God on its own terms. It consults the development of the redemptive narrative for answers, and engages typologies to trace big thematic elements in the Bible. This is why Biblical Theology is of particular interest to me.\nA Biblical Theology of Mission A Few Disclaimers I want to put my cards on the table by acknowledging that I am by no means a theological scholar, rather I am just a humble college student. I may grow excited in my writing about specific salvation-historical connections, but at the end of the day, there are some sobering facts to acknowledge about the mission of the people of God:\nGod is sovereign. (Ps. 115:3) Humanity cannot save themselves. (Eph. 2:1-3) God invites humanity into reconciliation, not only restoring humanity to a relationship with Himself, but inviting us to become co-laborers with Him. (2 Cor. 5:17-19) The entirety of the people of God will be able to worship God in unity with Christ, resulting in passionate praise for all eternity. (Rev. 5:9-10) God invites His people to participate in this outpouring of salvation by enabling them to become lights in a dark world; the people of God are not the source of the light, but the conduit. (2 Cor. 4:5-7) One more disclaimer is that the discipline of Biblical Theology is like a game of pick-up-sticks. It is hard to trace one particular theme without disturbing or untangling it from other themes in Scripture, as they are heavily interwoven. Hence, in this article I may gloss over really important facts that are relevant but mostly relate to other themes in Scripture.\nThe Original Comission When God created the earth, He created His image within a garden sanctuary. It was the place where the people had intimate communion with God. Afterwards, humanity reject this calling by imitating the serpent. Ultimately, God still wanted to magnify Himself in the universe, with the people that He had originally created. After cursing the earth, God still promised to deliver His people from their rebellion, restoring them to be right-working image-bearers of Himself.\nA Blessing for All Nations We get a glimpse for God’s plan to reconcile all peoples to Himself when He commissions Abram to go forth to possess a specific portion of Canaan.\n‘Now the Lord said …","date":1680480005,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680480005,"objectID":"128b7d1038247412cb140c3754e8bdb3","permalink":"https://carsonslater.com/post/bibtheomissions/","publishdate":"2023-04-03T00:00:05Z","relpermalink":"/post/bibtheomissions/","section":"post","summary":"Mission was not made for the church.

It can easily be boiled down to be a means to an end.

His name was Epaphroditus, and a short blurb was written about him in Philippians 2:25-30.\nAccording to Paul, Epaphroditus was sent to him in Rome by the church of Philippi, and he was able to deliver necessary supplies to Paul to assist with his ministry. Although it does not specify how, Epaphroditus nearly dies of illness while on this journey. I want to highlight what Paul says about him though:\n“I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need.”2\nEpaphroditus was used as the tangible component of the church of Philippi’s partnership with Paul. Recall that in chapter 1 of Philippians,3 Paul writes about his partnership with the church of Philippi. Here are some of the things he writes about them as his supporters:\nEvery time he thinks of them, he thanks God. (v. 3-4) He considers them partners in the gospel. (v. 5) He reminds the church of the perfect work of Jesus in them being brought to completion via sanctification. (v. 6) He considers them partakers of grace. (v. 7) My hope and prayer is that if you choose to partner with me in prayer or with financial support, please let me know and reach out! I would love to pray for you as you partake in the grace that God has bestowed upon you and others in your proximity. We can partner together to make known the riches of the Lord’s kindness. I certainly have been forgiven much, so it only makes sense that I love others much by sharing a salvific message with them, to the glory of God.\nReducing the supporter-supportee relationship to a transaction yields minimal fruit, if any. There are so many blessings that come from that rich fellowship, and the Paul-Philippi example is no exception.\nAn Invitation to Co-Labor My heartbeat behind support raising is to invite people into ministry through prayer and financial support. I hope to engage in mutual encouragement and prayer to labor and yearn for the kingdom of God on this earth together, and the for redemption of the lost. I pray that reports of my efforts would elicit or inspire a Spirit-driven desire within you to engage in gospel work where you are at. Thank you to everyone who has set such a phenomenal example for me in my upbringing of this.\nBOLD Faith I believe that if God is bigger than all I can ask or imagine, and that if He calls me His son, He would have no problem with me asking for great things in bold faith. God is investing in His children to yield a return of 30, 60, or 100 fold! Investors want their investments to yield 100-fold returns! That is exactly why I am inviting everyone I can into this partnership, asking for as much as they are able to give cheerfully. I am so excited to see what God does this summer when He chooses to move in the regions of central and eastern Europe. I truly hold onto this exhortation in 2 Corinthians:\n‘“And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work.”4\nNice Theory, but What About Practice? How will I invite you into this?\nIf you haven’t already received one, I’d love to send you a support letter! It gives details of my trip, what I’ll be doing, and what to pray for as I prepare for my summer missionary internship.\nAdditionally, if you feel led, I invite you to give!

My prayer is that you grow in the assurance of your calling to reconciliation with God and His mission on this earth.\nMy Prior Experiences Last summer, I had the amazing opportunity to join a team from my church in Arizona on a trip to the Czech Republic where we partnered with a local Czech church to facilitate an English Camp. At this camp, we shared the gospel with youth in their area through various talks and small group discussions in the evenings. I embarked on the trip with an awareness of Europe’s larger attitude toward Protestant Christianity, having previously served in Romania three times, but I came back to the States with a yearning to return, in order that I may continue to walk in the good works the Lord has prepared for me.\nI am excited to write to you now to inform you that God has provided an opportunity for me to return to the Czech Republic, only for a longer period of time. After going to Europe to engage people with the gospel four times, I cannot deny the strategy I see behind living in Europe as a Christian, let alone serving alongside missionaries who are already actively working there.\nMy ‘Why’ I currently attend college in a city that is ranked on this list for the most churches per capita in the world. I grew up less than a mile away from two large churches, and even a Presbyterian church to sweeten the deal. My experiences in Europe have shown me that a European mega-church usually consists of around 100 members, as opposed to the 2,000+ members that I am prone to visualize when I picture a stereotypical American mega-church.\nI mention this to illustrate that in America, people actually have options of where they choose to go to church, which is not a reality everywhere in Europe. This disparity points to the notion that there is much work to be done in exposing people to the gospel in Europe. There are so many people in Europe living a life that has never been exposed to Jesus in a personal way.\nThe population of the Czech Republic is approximately 0.737% evangelical 1. That’s right. Less than a percent. However, this percent has a growth rate of 0.3% per year! There are believers on the ground in this nation, and I am honored to be given the opportunity to walk alongside them for two and a half months.\nMy Posture Last summer, I was able to serve at English Camp with a Church in Český Těšín, CZ. I was coming out of a very heavy season of life, where I had just quit baseball (I had played for 13 years and gotten to the college level) and was convicted that I had used it as an means to glorify myself. I had been drawn to missions in high school before, but after coming to Wheaton, I was less mindful of it while pursuing other passions that I have since deemed as not conducive to spiritual growth.\nAs I was in this heavy season, one of my pastors at my church in Wheaton shared a verse with me before I left for Europe last summer.\n“For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.”\n(Ephesians 2:10 NASB)\nAlthough I was encouraged when I heard it, I had no clue how clear this would become while I was serving. I was able to reframe missions as my participation in building the most honorable kingdom - the kingdom of God. Missions was not the passion of my past, rather it was restored as a means by which I could walk in the good works God has prepared for me. I want to accept this invitation from the Lord to partake in His masterful building plan for His kingdom.\nBy no means am I saying that missions is the ONLY way to walk in the good works God has prepared for me. That would be to suppose the sacred-secular divide is real, which is not true. I just know that the Holy Spirit empowered me to get excited about sharing my first love with other people.\nHence, I am going back. I am by no means sufficient to carry this out on my own, but I know God’s power is perfected in my weakness. I just need to act in faith and obedience.\nχάριτος καἰ εἰρήνη,\n(grace and peace)\n- Carson\nP.S.

What: This is a place where I plan on sharing my thoughts, experienes, and things I have found to be encouragements in my life! Why: This blog is inspired by my desire to encourage people to follow Jesus. More specifically, I was inspired by a practice my church group did when we were serving in the Czech Republic through an organization called Josiah Venture, where we blogged about our experiences to bring our local church body alongside us our Journey. To Whom: The intended audience for this blog is anyone who is partnering with me in my endeavors to share the gospel with youth. While my intended audience is limited, this blog is actually for anyone and everyone! Please join in praying for me as I prepare to spend my summer as an intern with Josiah Venture! What do you plan on posting here? I hope to share with you my experiences preparing for my JV summer internship, as well as my experiences during the internship. After my time in Czechía, I will be able to reflect on the things that God was showing me along the way!\nI also have ambitions to publish some of my own writing here - mainly about books I want to review, ideas I want to share, and things I would love to invite you to consider!\nWhat is JosiahVenture? Josiah Venture is a mission organization focused on raising up youth leaders in Central and Eastern Europe. Their mission statement can be found on their website, but I’ve retrieved it here for you:\n\u0026#34;This is the vision of Josiah Venture, a vision for a movement of God among the youth of Central and Eastern Europe that finds its home in the local church and transforms society. Our mission and calling is to equip young leaders to fulfill Christ’s commission by reaching and making disciples. More than just conversion, we want to see passionate followers of Jesus Christ, with a vision to reach and disciple their generation for him.\u0026#34; The heartbeat behind Josiah Venture is actually derived from the story of King Josiah of Israel (read here). He inherits the throne of Israel at age eight. He did what was right in the eyes of God, purged the nation of places reserved for idol worship, and sought to reorient the people to follow God once again. As an organization, Josiah Venture seeks to find and raise up more Josiah’s across Central and Eastern Europe.\nHow will you be serving? I will be serving alongside the current Josiah Venture missionaries that are already in Czechía by partnering with local churches to promote, plan, and facilitate English Camps across the country.\nCan you give me a preview of what this will look like somehow? I can’t exactly look into the future, but I imagine it will look similar to the camp I served last summer, when my church in AZ partnered with a local Czech church. Check it out here!\nConclusion I hope I anticipated the questions you might have. If not, feel free to contact me with more questions via the form on the home page. I was led to create this blog in December 2022, and it is super fun to finally see it come to fruition. Glory be to God, and may this page be one that is edifying to all who read it!\nMy hope and prayer is that if you have chosen to let Jesus rule over your life, that you may be spurred on to love and good works (Hebrews 10:24), and that if you do not yet have Jesus as the ruler of your life, that you’d stick around for the sake of curiosity. After all, I’ll probably be posting more than just summer preparatory items on here! χάριτος καἰ εἰρήνη,\n(grace and peace)\n- Carson\n","date":1676073605,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676073605,"objectID":"f6f6692b1fd72cfa76791af88c447ed3","permalink":"https://carsonslater.com/post/welcome/","publishdate":"2023-02-11T00:00:05Z","relpermalink":"/post/welcome/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome! 👋 I created this blog to share my thoughts, encouragements, and experiences of my life with God with you!","tags":["Missions","Blog"],"title":"Welcome to my blog!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Carson Slater"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.
