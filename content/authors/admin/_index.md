Greetings! My name is Carson Slater, and I am really passionate about sharing my faith in Jesus Christ! I am currently finishing my studies at Wheaton College (IL) studying applied mathematics and economics. I am spending the upcoming summer in the Czech Republic, where I will be interning for an organization called Josiah Venture.
