# Why I read this book + preliminary thoughts.

As a part of my internship preparation, my intern director, [Josh Nelson](https://www.josiahventure.com/people-and-places/czech-republic/3876) (shout out to Josh) encouraged me to read Henry Nouwen's *In the Name of Jesus*. So, I decided to write this post to invite all who are praying for me into what I am processing before my internship!

From the moment I picked up this book, I knew it would be a convicting read. For those who do not know, Henry Nouwen is a prominent scholar who specialized in Christian ministry and ministerial psychology. Prior to writing this book, he served as a faculty member at Notre Dame's, Yale's and Harvard's Divinity schools.

Why do I allude to my sense of conviction? Well, the introduction recounts Nouwen's decision to leave academia in exchange for priesthood within a 
L'Arche commmunity (click [here](https://www.larcheusa.org/about/impact/) to learn more about L 'Arche).

To make matters more intense, the day I began to read this book, my pastor had literally given a sermon on how God is the one who reminds us of the dignity of the vulnerable, and that people's humanity does not come from their accomplishments, wealth, social capital, or abilities to aquire these things. A person's embodiment is enough to warrant dignity, because it means they have the Imago Dei! So I digress, I was interested to read this book and hear Nouwen's perspective. 

I was also drawn in because I personally was invited to visit and spend a night with a L 'Arche community my freshman year of college. Anecdotally, I remember being uncomfortable the whole time, but God has used those memories to redeem and formulate a posture of love toward the vulnerable as well as a deep commitment to uphold the dignity of handicapped people. Looking back on my [reflection assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SDFdjrkKMO6uW6tF8JuQ5yig__c1lmtG/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106641034707807322739&rtpof=true&sd=true), I have come so far. I read that document and realized how self-centered my writing was. If I could rewrite that assignment again, I would iterate that we would do well to have constant exposure from all kinds of people in our lives, including the mentally handicapped. They provide a piece of the Imago Dei that we would not otherwise have known, and they provide opportunities for us to invite them into Christian community.

# What Struck Me

### Being 'Relevant'
In the first section of the book, Nouwen describes the insecurities he experienced upon entering the L 'Arche community. Being an academic with some of the brightest students the world has to offer, he describes deeply feeling the contrast. He writes:

>"Not being able to use any of the skills that have proved so practical in the past was a real source of anxiety. I was suddenly faced with my naked self, open for affirmations and rejections, hugs and punches, smiles and tears, all dependent simply on how I was perceived at the moment. In a way, it seemed as though I was starting my life all over again."

I deeply resonated with this, feeling similarly about exiting a context recently where I spend so much time and had many talents (i.e. playing baseball). The truth I reflected upon while engaging this writing is that nothing is wasted, even though sometimes I feel I have had no preparation for the things being thrown at me.

Nouwen took this notion a step further, to point out how he wanted to give into the temptation to rely on his accolates and be 'relevant.' The thing is about L 'Arche communities though, is that being a Harvard professor does not help you acquire much social capital. Stepping into this new community for Nouwen was an opportunity to fall back on His true identity as a Son of God, rather than an accomplished academic.

I can anticipate myself experiencing this same temptation this summer in a foreign culture. I do not think that most students at my camps will care that I played NCAA baseball, or am entering a Statistics PhD program. These are great things, but temporal, transient features of my short time on this side of heaven. I pray I can meet students where they are at, giving up my desire to be 'relevant.'

### Searching for Love in the Wrong Places

Nouwen claims our desire to be 'relevant' is inextricably tied to our desire to be loved. Naturally, we crave love from the people around us whom we deem significant in our lives (parents, children, spouses, friends), but Nouwen points out this love as secondary to the true love -- the "first love" found in our intimate relationship with God. Love within interpersonal relationships are often the source of frustration, resentment, and anger, but God's love is untainted and abundantly more than sufficient.

>"The radical good news is that the second love is only a broken reflection of the first love, and that the first love is offered to us by a God, in whom there are no shadows. Jesus's heart is the incarnation of the shadow-free first love of God."

What does it truly mean to live each day, knowing you are beloved?

Nouwen takes to mysticism as the answer. (Christian) Mysticism is where a way where person is keenly aware of the love of God, via various spiritual practices. I believe Julian of Norwich is the default mystic most people think of, knowing about her *Revelations of Divine Love*.

Nouwen would say that the Christian leader is truly after the heart of Christ, the "first love." They are secure in their identity as adopted and beloved, and they are consumed with the desire dwell in the presence of God (like in [Psalm 84:10-12](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.84.10-12.NIV)!). This desire for intimacy with God manifests itself in contemplative, introspective, and worshipful prayer. It bears the fruit of wisdom and sound judgement, going beyond moral behavior modification.

>"But when we are securely rooted in personal intimacy with the source of life, it will be impossible to remain flexible without being relativistic, convinced without being rigid, willing to confront without being offensive, gentle and forgiving without being soft, and true witnesses without being manipulative."
